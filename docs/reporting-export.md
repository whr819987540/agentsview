title: Reporting Export
description: Canonical hourly activity and usage exports for reporting integrations
---

Use `agentsview export hour`, `day`, and `digest` to build reports from the
local SQLite archive. Each export identifies its UTC period and includes a
content digest: a checksum that changes when the exported data changes. Your
integration can use these digests to find corrections and replace saved hours.

## Commands

```bash
agentsview export hour --schema-version 3 2026-07-28-13
agentsview export day --schema-version 3 2026-07-28
agentsview export digest --schema-version 3 --from 2026-06-28 --to 2026-07-27
```

All dates and hours are UTC and must use the exact zero-padded forms shown
above. An hour is available only after it has closed. A past date contains 24
hours; the current UTC date contains only closed hours and has no day digest.
Digest ranges are inclusive, require both bounds, and may contain at most 31
dates.

Version 3 is the default. Hour, day, and digest commands also accept
`--schema-version 4` for joint cells; versions 1 and 2 are no longer available.
Any other value is rejected before the archive is opened or output is written.
Integrations pinned to an older version must update to version 3 and refresh
their saved digests.

Each successful command writes exactly one canonical JSON document followed by
one newline. Diagnostics go to stderr. A malformed or future period, an open
hour, a reversed or oversized digest range, or an unavailable archive produces a
non-zero exit.

## Discover the reporting range

Run `agentsview export range` before choosing dates for a historical import. It
reads the local SQLite archive directly and writes one canonical JSON document:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "earliest_date": "2026-06-01",
  "closed_through": "2026-07-29T14:00:00Z"
}
```

`earliest_date` is a conservative UTC starting date for dated activity or usage
in closed hours. It includes subagents and forks, usage-only sessions,
standalone Cursor usage, message and usage timestamps older than session
metadata, terminal tool executions, and session start or creation fallbacks for
untimed activity. Deleted sessions, ineligible usage, invalid timestamps, and
timestamps in open or future hours do not establish a bound. The starting date
can precede the first nonempty report because discovery does not perform the
full activity aggregation or usage deduplication.

`closed_through` is the exclusive UTC hour cutoff. In the example, hours before
14:00 are closed; the 14:00 hour is still open. An archive with no dated
reporting evidence before that cutoff returns `"earliest_date": null` and still
returns the cutoff. This includes an empty archive.

Range schema 1 is independent of the hour, day, and digest schemas. The command
exports no projects, session lists, or conversation text and accepts no report
scope or schema options. It does not migrate the archive; an archive that
requires an upgrade must first be opened by the matching writable version.

These bounds describe availability, not a completeness guarantee or an import
checkpoint. Late imports, corrections, and deletions can change older reports.
Keep using date and hour digests to find those changes, and split digest reads
into ranges of at most 31 dates.

## Hour and day documents

The v3 hour shape is:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 3,
  "period": "2026-07-28-13",
  "digest": "sha256:...",
  "has_data": true,
  "activity": {
    "totals": {},
    "peak": {},
    "interactive_peak": {},
    "subagent_peak": {},
    "automated_peak": {},
    "buckets": [],
    "by_model": [],
    "by_agent": [],
    "by_project": []
  },
  "usage": {
    "totals": {},
    "by_model": [],
    "by_agent": [],
    "by_project": []
  }
}
```

Version 3 contains exactly twelve consecutive five-minute activity buckets.
Version 4 declares the bucket duration explicitly and permits other resolutions.
Activity separates interactive sessions, subagents, and automated sessions.
Subagents take precedence over automation, so an automated child belongs only to
the subagent category. Totals and all model, agent, and project breakdowns carry
separate minutes and costs for each category. Combined minutes, cost, tokens,
and peak concurrency still include all three categories.

`interactive_peak`, `subagent_peak`, and `automated_peak` contain each
category's independent maximum and its earliest timestamp. Each bucket also
includes `max_interactive_agents`, `max_subagent_agents`, and
`max_automated_agents`. These maxima may occur at different times. The
`interactive_at_peak`, `subagent_at_peak`, and `automated_at_peak` fields
instead describe the composition at that bucket's combined peak.

Activity totals include additive first-seen counts for sessions, interactive,
subagent, and automated sessions, untimed sessions, projects, and models.
`new_interactive_sessions + new_subagent_sessions + new_automated_sessions`
equals `new_sessions`; untimed sessions are counted separately and may belong to
any category. A session's first-seen hour is the start of its earliest effective
activity interval after the five-minute gap cap and export-range clipping.
Without such an interval, the fallback order is an in-range session usage event,
activity event, `started_at`, then `created_at`; fallback-only sessions are
untimed.

Every activity total and model, agent, or project breakdown serializes
`agent_minutes` as the exact floating-point sum of
`automated_agent_minutes + interactive_agent_minutes + subagent_agent_minutes`.
Before serialization, the exporter validates the original total and all three
components as finite and non-negative. Given
`derived = automated + interactive + subagent`, the accepted difference is:

```text
abs(original - derived) <= 1e-9 * max(1, abs(original), abs(derived))
```

The boundary is inclusive; a larger difference is rejected.

Usage totals carry input, output, cache-creation, and cache-read tokens plus
cost. Reporting collects activity-eligible sessions, usage-eligible sessions,
and standalone observations independently through one read transaction.
Session-linked and standalone rows are merged before ordering, deduplication,
cost allocation, or aggregation. The resulting complete usage stream feeds
totals and all `by_model`, `by_agent`, and `by_project` breakdowns.

Usage-only sessions load the minimal metadata needed for agent and project
attribution without becoming activity sessions. Standalone observations have no
session or project, so they contribute to usage totals, `by_model`, and
`by_agent` without receiving fabricated `by_project` attribution. Only rows
attached to activity-eligible sessions feed activity minutes, buckets, peaks,
breakdowns, first-seen state, or an activity `new_*` counter. Activity token and
cost totals can therefore differ from usage totals. Money is encoded as integer
microdollars. Project breakdowns include both a safe display label and a stable
archive-scoped `project_key`.

A day document contains its UTC `date`, `complete` and `has_data` flags, its
ordered closed-hour documents, and a `digest` only when all 24 hours are
present. `agentsview export hour H` is constructed by the same day reader and
emits byte-for-byte the canonical hour element contained by `export day D`.

## Joint bucket cells (version 4)

Version 4 keeps version 3's accounting rules and adds a `joint` object to every
hour. Independent project, model and agent breakdowns cannot answer a combined
filter such as "model A on project B". Joint cells retain those relationships
without exporting session identifiers, titles, messages or tool content.

```sh
agentsview export day --schema-version 4 2026-07-28
agentsview export day --schema-version 4 --bucket 1m 2026-07-28
agentsview export hour --schema-version 4 --project-key <project-key> 2026-07-28-13
agentsview export digest --schema-version 4 --project-key <project-key> \
  --from 2026-07-01 --to 2026-07-28
```

Repeat `--project-key` to include more projects. Get the archive-scoped keys
from the project breakdowns or a session export's project map. No keys means the
whole archive, including unattributed usage. An explicit key selects only that
project; an unknown key produces an empty replacement, not an error. An empty
key is invalid. Version 3 rejects project selection.

`--bucket` selects the duration for both activity buckets and joint cells. It
accepts any positive whole-minute duration that divides one hour, such as `1m`,
`2m`, `5m`, `15m`, or `1h`. Five minutes is the default, not a fixed contract
limit. Version 3 rejects explicit bucket selection and retains its original
bytes. Invalid durations fail before the archive is opened.

Every v4 hour, day and digest document carries `bucket_seconds`, including empty
documents. Every hour in a day uses that duration. Bucket starts align to the
UTC hour, and activity always includes `3600 / bucket_seconds` buckets; joint
cells remain sparse. The five-minute inactivity gap cap is independent of bucket
size. One-minute exports still use the same activity and accounting rules.

The selected scope applies to the **whole hour**, including existing totals,
breakdowns and per-device bucket maxima. The exporter chooses canonical usage
survivors and allocates authoritative costs before applying scope. A duplicate
observation excluded by that selection cannot become a new charge just because
its winning observation belongs to another project. This is export selection,
not an authorization check; callers still own permission and destination rules.

`joint.project_keys` contains the sorted, unique requested keys (`[]` for the
whole archive). `joint.cells` is a sparse array with these fields:

| Field                         | Meaning                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bucket_start`                | UTC start of a half-open bucket lasting `bucket_seconds`                                        |
| `project`, `project_key`      | Safe display label and canonical archive-scoped key; an empty key is unattributed               |
| `agent`, `model`              | Producer agent and model; `unknown` when absent                                                 |
| `automation`                  | `interactive`, `subagent`, `automated`, or `unknown` without session classification             |
| `agent_minutes`, `max_agents` | Sum of inferred activity durations and simultaneous peak within this cell                       |
| `usage`                       | Input, output, cache-creation and cache-read tokens, plus cost in integer microdollars          |
| `pricing`                     | `computed_cost`, `reported_cost`, `allocated_cost` in integer microdollars, and `unpriced_rows` |

### Project identity evidence

`joint.projects` maps each nonempty cell project key to a safe `display_label`,
`resolution`, and an `identity` when resolved. It is part of the hour's digest,
read from the same SQLite transaction as the activity and usage. It contains no
session identifiers or raw filesystem paths. Empty hours have an empty catalog;
standalone usage has no project identity.

The cell key identifies an archive-scoped display label, **not a repository**.
Different repositories can have the same label. A `resolved` entry means every
session contributing activity or canonical usage under that key in the hour has
a matching source-label snapshot and the same resolved project identity. Missing
snapshots or mismatched labels produce `unknown`; conflicting identities or
ambiguous snapshots produce `ambiguous`. Neither carries an identity. A known
repository never supplies identity for another session with missing evidence.
Resolution covers the whole project key in the hour, even when its cells use
different models or buckets.

Identities use the existing project identity fields: `key`, `kind`,
`repository_key`, and, for `git_remote`, a credential-free `normalized_remote`.
Machine-root identities retain opaque scoped keys; they do not prove that a
consumer's configured filesystem path matches. Consumers own permission checks:
match verified identity evidence to their policy, never a display label. Missing
catalogs, unresolved entries, or identities that cannot establish the requested
permission must not authorize detailed cells.

Identity-only changes alter the hour and day digests, so ordinary correction
screening discovers them. The exporter loads session snapshots in bounded
batches once per day export, then builds each hour's catalog from its actual
contributors; it does not query the archive once per hour or inspect live
checkouts.

### Cell measurements

The `automation` field uses the same disjoint categories as activity totals.
Subagents are labeled `subagent` even when their automation flag is set.
Activity and usage share this classification, so subagents remain separate from
other sessions with the same project, agent, model, and bucket. Standalone usage
keeps `unknown`.

Known cost is partitioned across the three pricing fields; their sum is the
cell's usage cost. `allocated_cost` identifies an authoritative total
apportioned by the existing accounting rules, not separately measured
per-message spend. `unpriced_rows` counts canonical usage observations without
complete pricing. Known fees still contribute to cost when token prices are
unknown; that cost is incomplete, not free usage. Activity-only cells have zero
usage. Usage without an activity interval still contributes tokens and cost, but
not invented minutes. Usage is assigned by observation timestamp, not spread
over an activity interval.

Activity uses the same gap cap, model attribution, clipping and overlap removal
as the Activity report. Agent-minutes are not measured human working time. A
report edge inside a cell has the declared bucket precision; consumers must not
prorate that cell and claim an exact instant-level result.

### Concurrency and corrections

Resolution is part of the hour's content identity, not a new publication period.
Changing it replaces the complete cell set and activity buckets for the same
hour and scope, including quiet hours. Consumers must remove the old resolution
instead of adding both sets together, and screen digests with the same
`--bucket` as their exports. Finer buckets do not require more frequent uploads.
Consumers can roll up to aligned multiples of the stored duration, but cannot
recover finer detail from coarse buckets or invent missing precision. Combining
different resolutions requires a common aligned coarser grain.

A model switch can create two cells for one session in the same bucket. Adding
their maxima can overstate even a single device's peak. For selected cells in a
bucket, use this upper bound across devices:

```text
sum over devices of min(device bucket max_agents,
                       sum of that device's selected cell max_agents)
```

Take the maximum bucket bound for a window-level bound. The companion device
maximum is `activity.buckets[].max_agents` from the same permitted export scope.
This is not exact selected concurrency or exact cross-device concurrency.

Cells are sorted by bucket, project key, agent, model and automation. Their
entire contents and requested project scope participate in the hour digest,
including for quiet hours. A changed hour replaces its entire previous cell set
in the same scope; removed cells are retractions. An empty set retracts all
previous cells. Never append a replacement as additional usage, or combine
overlapping export scopes as independent sources.

Old parser corrections, project changes, pricing changes and deletions can
change a closed hour. Re-export and replace it when its digest changes; closing
an hour does not freeze its meaning. Version 4 does not add a history checkpoint
or a deletion journal. Digest screening still computes full day exports before
returning identities, and a single-hour command still reads the corresponding
day. Joint export adds aggregation and output proportional to the populated
cells; it is not a source-side incremental optimization.

## Quiet hours

A quiet hour means that the archive has no activity or usage observation for
that period. It deliberately does not mean that an agent was observed idle for
60 minutes. A quiet hour therefore has:

- `has_data: false`;
- `idle_minutes: 0`;
- zero-valued activity buckets covering the complete hour (twelve at the default
  five-minute resolution);
- empty activity and usage breakdown arrays; and
- zero first-seen counters.

A completed date with 24 quiet hours still has a stable, non-empty day digest.
The separate `has_data` flag distinguishes content presence from document
identity.

## Snapshot and digest guarantees

Every day is assembled from one SQLite read transaction. Sessions, messages,
usage rows, pricing, and project identity therefore describe one coherent
archive snapshot even when a sync writes concurrently. Usage deduplication and
authoritative session-cost allocation happen once on the merged usage stream
across the day before rows are partitioned by hour. All dates in one digest
share that read transaction, while survivor selection and session-cost
allocation still run independently for each date.

Usage selects the greatest output-token snapshot for each Claude message/request
identity before generic deduplication, retains the earliest session for
attribution, and carries the maximum observed web-search count into pricing.
Usage rows are ordered by occurrence time, session ID ascending, and
`COALESCE(message_ordinal, -1)` ascending. A standalone row retains its empty
session ID and therefore sorts before a session-linked row at the same time.
Source and the remaining semantic fields provide deterministic tie-breakers only
after that shared ordering prefix.

Arrays use stable contract ordering. Canonical JSON preserves declared JSON
field names and encodes money exactly. Reporting exports use a project-specific
canonical format and do not claim RFC 8785 or JSON Canonicalization Scheme
compliance. Its byte rules are:

- Go JSON field names, `omitempty`, and custom marshalers are applied first;
- object keys sort lexicographically by UTF-16 code units;
- array order is preserved;
- output contains no insignificant whitespace;
- strings use Go JSON escaping with HTML escaping disabled: `<`, `>`, and `&`
  remain literal, defined short control escapes such as `\b` and `\f` are
  used, other control characters use `\u00xx`, and U+2028/U+2029 are escaped;
- integers use minimal base-10 form and preserve their complete value, including
  values above `2^53`;
- negative zero is encoded as `0`;
- finite floating-point values use the shortest round-trippable decimal form,
  with plain notation from magnitude `1e-6` through values below `1e21` and
  normalized exponent notation outside that range; and
- non-finite numbers are rejected.

Digests are derived as follows:

1. An hour digest is SHA-256 over the canonical hour content with the derived
   `digest` field omitted.
1. A completed-day digest is SHA-256 over the canonical ordered array of its 24
   hour digest strings.
1. An incomplete current date has ordered hour digests but no day digest.

`export digest` returns only those identities and presence flags:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 3,
  "from": "2026-07-27",
  "to": "2026-07-28",
  "days": [
    {
      "date": "2026-07-27",
      "complete": true,
      "has_data": false,
      "day_digest": "sha256:...",
      "hour_digests": ["sha256:..."]
    }
  ]
}
```

Consumers can screen completed dates by `day_digest`, then compare the 24
ordered `hour_digests` and fetch only changed hours.

### Canonical vectors

These vectors contain the complete canonical UTF-8 text with no trailing
newline. SHA-256 is computed over exactly those bytes.

```text
Input:     {"\ue000":"bmp","\ud800\udc00":"astral"}
Canonical: {"𐀀":"astral","":"bmp"}
SHA-256:   5e72745dd500f8b8d997ef851679707b89099da29d2aca4b93dfd85810ebaa20

Input:     {"text":"<>&\b\f\u2028\u2029"}
Canonical: {"text":"<>&\b\f\u2028\u2029"}
SHA-256:   654cd6bbd6c7311e46686b6cbf6dbfc9f092258e669b2d0ce2f286a5e81dd2bb

Input:     {"n":9007199254740993}
Canonical: {"n":9007199254740993}

Input:     {"small":0.0000001,"plain":0.000001,"negative_zero":-0.0,"large":1e21}
Canonical: {"large":1e+21,"negative_zero":0,"plain":0.000001,"small":1e-7}
SHA-256:   940f129aabf5afc6800add24fbf597727e9dc6316f6ae10adbc78a3362b1c483
```

## Versioning

Version 3 separates subagents from interactive and automated sessions and adds
independent concurrency peaks for each category. It retains the complete Claude
snapshot selection and web-search charging introduced in version 2. Versions 1
and 2 are no longer emitted.

Version 4 adds scoped joint cells and selectable bucket duration while version 3
remains the default.

Integrations should request and require their intended `schema_version`, reject
unknown fields, and verify the canonical content digest before accepting an
hour. The new fields change hour and day digests, including quiet hours; refresh
previously saved digests when updating. Adding, renaming, or removing a field,
changing a type or accounting rule, or changing canonicalization requires a new
schema version.

## Local SQLite scope

Reporting export intentionally uses the existing read-only local SQLite export
path. It can run while the writable daemon owns the archive, and it does not
require that daemon to be running. It does not switch to PostgreSQL or DuckDB:
the local archive is the canonical source for the device's reporting payload,
dedup order, pricing view, and archive-scoped project keys.

Costs use reported charges when available and catalog estimates otherwise.
Estimates use the pricing catalog visible when the export reads the archive. The
export does not preserve the catalog revision from when an hour closed. A later
pricing change can therefore change an hour's estimated cost and digest without
changing token counts. Treat that change as an ordinary correction and replace
the saved hour.

When the archive has no stored model-pricing rows, the read-only reporting
command applies the embedded fallback catalog and configured custom prices in
memory. It does not write to the archive or replace a non-empty stored catalog.

The sum of a completed export day's usage fields reconciles with the Usage view
for the same UTC date and filters. Usage-session selection follows usage
timestamps independently of the session activity window.

The checked-in fixtures under `cmd/agentsview/testdata/reporting/` freeze v3
bytes and their SHA-256 manifest for portable contract tests.

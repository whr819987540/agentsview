`agentsview stats` is a top-level CLI command added in 0.23.0 for window-scoped
reporting over your local session archive. It emits a human-readable summary by
default and can also emit JSON for scripts and downstream tooling.

!!! warning "Experimental"

    `agentsview stats` is experimental. The human-readable output is not stable, and
    the exact JSON output may change in future releases. Treat it as a moving
    surface and parse it defensively.

## What It Reports

The command pulls together several categories of information:

- **Session totals** — total sessions, human versus automation sessions, total
  messages, total user messages
- **Session archetypes** — automation, quick, standard, deep, and marathon
  buckets
- **Session shape** — mean duration, user-message counts, peak context, and
  tools-per-turn
- **Velocity** — turn-cycle timing, first-response timing, and messages per
  active hour
- **Tool, model, and agent mix** — top tool categories plus token and session
  mix by model and agent
- **Claude-only optional sections** — cache economics, plan-mode adoption,
  subagent activity, and skill counts when the window has compatible data
- **Temporal activity** — active UTC-hour buckets plus the reporter timezone
- **Git outcomes** — commit, LOC, file-change, and optional PR totals for repos
  enclosing session working directories
- **Session outcomes** — aggregate counts, grade distribution, retry rate,
  compactions per session, and edit churn. The raw
  [four outcomes](/docs/session-intelligence/#outcome-classification)
  (`completed`, `abandoned`, `errored`, `unknown`) are rolled up here into
  three buckets: `success` (= `completed`), `failure` (= `abandoned` or
  `errored`), and `unknown` (= `unknown` plus any unrecognized value). The
  rollup applies to both the human summary and the JSON `outcomes` block.
- **Code attribution** — optional AI-authored code attribution from host-local
  attribution sources such as Cursor.

## Automation Scope

As of 0.25.0, `agentsview stats` uses each session's stored `is_automated` value
as the authority for human versus automation scope. That classification drives
session totals, archetypes, the `scope_human` distributions, and the
human-scoped `agent_portfolio` fields (`by_sessions_human`, `by_messages_human`,
`by_tokens_human`, and `primary_human`). `scope_all` still includes every
session in the selected window.

For the `user_messages.scope_human` distribution only, sessions with fewer than
two user messages are omitted from that distribution's mean and buckets because
the human bucket set starts at two user messages. They still contribute to
`scope_all` and to the session totals according to their `is_automated` value.

## Usage

```bash
# Human-readable summary for the last 28 days
agentsview stats

# Fixed date range as JSON
agentsview stats --format json --since 2026-04-01 --until 2026-04-15

# Narrow to one agent and one project
agentsview stats --agent claude --include-project my-app
```

## Data Scope

Session-derived stats come from the daemon API. The command connects to the
local daemon or starts one, and the daemon reads the selected window from its
archive. If a read-only daemon cannot provide stats, the command reports that
error. It does not switch to a separate local SQLite archive.

Code attribution is different: it is not synced session data. When present, the
Cursor source in the `code_attribution.sources` array is read live from the
Cursor attribution database on the host answering the stats request:
`~/.cursor/ai-tracking/ai-code-tracking.db` by default, or the path in
`AGENTSVIEW_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTION_DB`.

That means the Cursor source is machine-local. It is not aggregated across
synced machines, is not pushed to PostgreSQL, and is not available from
PostgreSQL read-only serving. Project filters cannot be represented against
Cursor's attribution database, so project-filtered stats include a Cursor source
with `status: "unsupported_filter"` instead of silently reporting zero
attribution.

## Human Output

The default human output is organized into named sections. Depending on the data
available in the selected window, you may see:

- `Totals`
- `Archetypes`
- `Session shape`
- `Velocity`
- `Tool mix`
- `Model mix`
- `Agent portfolio`
- `Cache economics`
- `Adoption`
- `Temporal`
- `Outcome stats`
- `Outcomes`
- `Code attribution`

Some sections are optional. For example, git-based outcome stats are omitted
when AgentsView cannot derive any repos from the sessions in the selected
window, and Claude-only sections are omitted when the window has no compatible
data.

## JSON Output

JSON output currently carries `schema_version: 1` and is divided into top-level
blocks such as:

- `window`
- `filters`
- `totals`
- `distributions`
- `archetypes`
- `velocity`
- `tool_mix`
- `model_mix`
- `agent_portfolio`
- `temporal`
- `generated_at`

Optional blocks may also appear:

- `cache_economics`
- `adoption`
- `outcome_stats`
- `outcomes`
- `code_attribution`

`code_attribution.sources` lists attribution sources that contributed to the
selected stats request. Each source carries `provider`, `scope`, `status`,
optional `warnings`, and provider-specific `metrics`. The Cursor source
currently uses `scope: "machine_local"`.

Current source statuses are `available`, `empty`, `unavailable`, `error`, and
`unsupported_filter`. Check a source's `warnings` before interpreting missing
metrics or zero counters as zero AI code activity. If an agent filter excludes
Cursor, the Cursor source is omitted. If no source contributes, the whole
`code_attribution` block is omitted.

Even though the JSON currently includes a version number, it is still best to
treat it as experimental and additive: expect new fields, optional blocks, and
formatting changes over time.

## Git And PR Aggregation

`agentsview stats` uses session working directories to discover git repositories
and then aggregates git activity for the configured author in each repo.

That includes:

- commit counts
- lines added and removed
- files changed

Pull-request counts are optional and use CLI-oriented GitHub token sources:

- If `AGENTSVIEW_GITHUB_TOKEN` is set, AgentsView uses it.
- Otherwise it tries `gh auth token`.
- If neither source yields a token, PR counts are omitted instead of being
  reported as zero.

This distinction matters in JSON output: a missing PR field means "GitHub lookup
not configured", not "configured and zero PRs found".

## Relationship To Session Intelligence

[`Session Intelligence`](/docs/session-intelligence/) is the per-session surface
for health scores, outcomes, and signal inspection.

`agentsview stats` is the aggregate surface: it summarizes the whole archive
over a window rather than explaining one session at a time.

title: PostgreSQL Sync
description: Share sessions across machines with PostgreSQL push sync, an auto-push service, and a read-only server
---

AgentsView stores sessions locally in SQLite by default. PostgreSQL sync lets
you push sessions from one or more machines into a shared PostgreSQL database,
keep that database current with an optional auto-push watcher or OS service,
then serve a read-only web UI from it — useful for team dashboards or
multi-machine setups.

The PostgreSQL usage optimization baseline and its architecture boundary are
recorded in `docs/internal/pg-usage-native-optimization.md`.

The sync direction is one-way: SQLite to PostgreSQL. Each machine pushes its own
sessions; `pg serve` reads from the shared database. The resulting UI includes
the session browser, analytics dashboard, search, and, as of 0.23.0, the Usage
dashboard as well.

!!! note "Separate hosted raw sync"

    [Hosted Raw Sync](/docs/hosted-raw-sync/) is a separate path that keeps original
    provider artifacts in hosted custody through authenticated, resumable uploads.
    It does not yet turn accepted generations into hosted sessions or embeddings.
    This does not change `pg push`, `pg push --watch`, or the read-only session UI
    and APIs documented on this page.

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure PostgreSQL

Add a `[pg]` section to `~/.agentsview/config.toml`:

```toml
local_machine_name = "Laptop"

[pg]
url = "postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=require"
```

Sessions retain their source installation ID. `local_machine_name` supplies the
display label after a daemon restart and the next push. The optional
`[pg].machine_name` defaults to the installation ID and only supplies a key for
legacy `local` rows; it does not rename recorded session keys.

For multiple PostgreSQL destinations, use named `[pg.NAME]` blocks and
`default_pg` instead of the legacy single `[pg]` block. Named target names are
normalized case-insensitively, and `all`, `local`, plus the legacy `[pg]` field
names `url`, `schema`, `machine_name`, `allow_insecure`, `projects`, and
`exclude_projects` are unavailable as `[pg.NAME]` names.

### 2. Push Sessions

```bash
agentsview pg push
```

This one-shot command syncs all local sessions, messages, and tool calls to
PostgreSQL. The schema is created automatically on first push.

To keep PostgreSQL current automatically, run the foreground watcher:

```bash
agentsview pg push --watch
```

Or install it as a per-user background service on macOS or Linux:

```bash
agentsview pg service install
```

### 3. Serve the Dashboard

```bash
agentsview pg serve
```

Opens the read-only web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, backed entirely by
PostgreSQL. It does not use local SQLite or file watching, and its session UI
and APIs do not accept session uploads. A writable deployment can also expose
the separate
[hosted raw-sync control plane](/docs/hosted-raw-sync/#http-control-plane).

## Commands

### `agentsview pg push`

Sync sessions from the local SQLite database to PostgreSQL.

```bash
agentsview pg push [target] [flags]
```

| Flag                 | Default | Description                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--all`              | `false` | Push every configured PG target sequentially                              |
| `--full`             | `false` | Force full local resync and re-push, bypassing change detection           |
| `--no-vectors`       | `false` | Skip the semantic-search vector phase for this run                        |
| `--projects`         |         | Comma-separated projects to push (inclusive)                              |
| `--exclude-projects` |         | Comma-separated projects to exclude                                       |
| `--all-projects`     | `false` | Ignore configured project filters for this run                            |
| `--watch`            | `false` | Run continuously, pushing on change plus a periodic floor                 |
| `--debounce`         | `30s`   | Coalesce window after a filesystem change before pushing (`--watch` only) |
| `--interval`         | `15m`   | Periodic floor push interval (`--watch` only)                             |

Without `--watch`, push is on-demand — run it whenever you want to sync. With
`--watch`, the command stays in the foreground and keeps pushing until
interrupted.

When no target is passed, `pg push` uses the effective default target. Pass one
named target explicitly to push just that destination, or use `--all` to fan out
across every configured target. `--all --watch` is rejected.

**What happens on push:**

1. Runs a local sync to pick up any new or modified session files
1. Compares local sessions against the PostgreSQL watermark to find what changed
   since the last push
1. Upserts sessions, messages, tool calls, and (as of 0.30.0)
   [curation metadata](#curation-metadata) in batches of 50
1. Advances the watermark timestamp on success

Incremental pushes use a two-layer fingerprint to skip unchanged sessions:
first, session metadata fields (project, agent, timestamps, message counts) are
compared; then, per- session message statistics (count, content length
sum/max/min, system message ordinals, tool call counts) are checked against
PostgreSQL. Use `--full` to bypass both layers and re-push everything — for
example, after a schema reset or when message content was rewritten in place.

If any sessions fail to push, the watermark is not advanced so they are retried
on the next run. The exit code is 1 when any errors occur, 0 otherwise.

When a daemon handles an incremental push against a current archive, an
incomplete local ingestion pass still allows committed sessions to be copied.
The daemon logs the incomplete ingestion pass, while the command returns the
mirror push result, including any row errors or deferred vectors. Local sync
retries failed sources independently; a completed mirror push does not trigger
an immediate mirror retry just because ingestion was incomplete. A failed full
resync still blocks the push. Watcher batches keep their acknowledgement rules;
the startup and periodic unscoped pushes allow healthy archived sessions to
catch up.

#### Automatic Push Watcher

As of 0.32.0, `agentsview pg push --watch` runs a long-lived auto-push daemon in
the foreground:

```bash
agentsview pg push --watch
agentsview pg push --watch --debounce 1m
agentsview pg push --watch --interval 5m
```

The watcher performs one initial local sync plus PostgreSQL push, then pushes
again after session-directory changes settle for the debounce window. Ordinary
changes carry a bounded set of changed paths to the daemon, so a one-session
edit does not rediscover the full local archive. Watcher overflow, lost events,
and ambiguous renames promote to authoritative reconciliation of the currently
available provider roots. The interval acts as a floor: even if filesystem
events are missed or a root cannot be watched because of OS watch limits, the
next interval push catches up.

Operational details:

- Only one watcher can run per AgentsView data directory; a runtime lock
  prevents competing pushes from racing watermarks.
- PostgreSQL connections are opened lazily and reset after errors, so a
  transiently unavailable database is retried on the next trigger instead of
  crashing the watcher.
- On shutdown (`Ctrl+C`, `SIGTERM`), the watcher attempts one bounded final
  flush.
- Logs are written to `pg-watch.log` under the AgentsView data directory.
- The watcher uses the selected PostgreSQL target, or the `default_pg` target
  when no name is passed, along with the same machine name, project filters,
  classifier settings, and `result_content_blocked_categories` behavior as
  one-shot `pg push`.

#### Project Filtering

By default, `pg push` syncs all projects. Use project filters to push a subset:

```bash
# Push only these projects
agentsview pg push --projects alpha,beta

# Push everything except this project
agentsview pg push --exclude-projects scratch

# Ignore config-file filters for this run
agentsview pg push --all-projects
```

`--projects` and `--exclude-projects` are mutually exclusive. `--all-projects`
cannot be combined with either.

Project filters can also be set in `config.toml` so you don't need to pass them
on every run:

```toml
[pg]
url = "postgres://..."
projects = ["alpha", "beta"]
# or: exclude_projects = ["scratch"]
```

CLI flags override config values. Use
[`agentsview projects`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-projects) to list available
project names.

Filtered pushes keep their own local push watermark for each target/filter set.
For example, repeated `agentsview pg push --projects alpha,beta` runs use a
different watermark from unfiltered pushes and from
`agentsview pg push --projects gamma`. This keeps allow-list pushes incremental
without advancing the unfiltered/global cursor.

After upgrading from an older version, the first filtered push for a given
project set may still scan the matching local sessions once to seed that scoped
watermark. Later pushes with the same filter set use the scoped watermark.

#### Curation Metadata

As of 0.30.0, `pg push` also synchronizes two pieces of per-user curation state
alongside session content:

| PostgreSQL table   | What it holds                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `starred_sessions` | One row per starred session: `session_id`, `created_at`                                           |
| `pinned_messages`  | One row per pin: `id`, `session_id`, `message_id`, `ordinal`, `source_uuid`, `note`, `created_at` |

Stars are keyed by session ID and overwrite cleanly across machines. Pins are
reconciled by `source_uuid` — a stable identifier derived from the underlying
message — so a pin survives a re-parse that shifts message ordinals. Without
this, pins would silently drift to the wrong message after any session resync.

Curation tables are populated by the same `pg push` run; no separate command or
flag is required. The [`agentsview secrets`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-secrets)
findings also push through this codepath, with the same parity guarantees as
session content (`secret_findings` table, per-session `secret_leak_count`, and
the [`has-secret`](/docs/session-api/#agentsview-session-list) list filter).

#### Vector Push

When `[vector]` is enabled locally, `pg push` runs a vector phase after the
session and message phases, copying the machine's active embedding generation
from `vectors.db` into pgvector so a shared PostgreSQL deployment can answer
`--semantic`/`--hybrid`. Only changed sessions are re-sent. Skip the phase for
one run with `--no-vectors`, or disable it persistently with
`push_vectors = false` under `[pg]`. Databases without pgvector (for example
CockroachDB) skip the phase and keep syncing session content. See
[semantic search: PostgreSQL](/docs/semantic-search/#postgresql) for the full
push, serve, and maintenance workflow.

`pg vectors list` and `pg vectors drop <id>` inspect and remove pushed
generations.

### `agentsview pg status`

Show the current sync state.

```bash
agentsview pg status [target] [flags]
agentsview pg status --all
agentsview pg status --projects alpha,beta
```

Without a target name, `pg status` uses the effective default target. Pass one
named target explicitly to inspect that destination, or use `--all` to print
every configured target sequentially.

Use the same `--projects`, `--exclude-projects`, or `--all-projects` filter
flags as `pg push` to inspect the matching filtered or unfiltered watermark.

Output:

```
Machine:     my-laptop
Last push:   2026-03-24T10:30:00Z
PG sessions: 1842
PG messages: 47291
```

| Field       | Description                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Machine     | Configured machine key or installation ID        |
| Last push   | Timestamp of last successful push ("never" if no push yet) |
| PG sessions | Total session count in PostgreSQL (all machines)           |
| PG messages | Total message count in PostgreSQL (all machines)           |

### `agentsview pg service`

Install and manage the [`pg push --watch`](#automatic-push-watcher) auto-push
daemon as a per-user OS service.

```bash
agentsview pg service install
agentsview pg service status
agentsview pg service logs -f
agentsview pg service stop
agentsview pg service start
agentsview pg service uninstall
```

Supported service managers:

| Platform | Manager               |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| macOS    | launchd LaunchAgent   |
| Linux    | `systemd --user` unit |

The generated unit runs `agentsview pg push --watch`, pins `AGENTSVIEW_DATA_DIR`
to the data directory used at install time, and writes logs to
`~/.agentsview/pg-watch.log` unless you changed the data directory.

`install` requires a literal PostgreSQL URL in the effective default target of
`~/.agentsview/config.toml`, either the legacy `[pg].url` or the target selected
by `default_pg` from named `[pg.NAME]` blocks. It intentionally rejects
`AGENTSVIEW_PG_URL` and environment-expanded URLs such as `${PG_PASSWORD}`
because background services do not inherit your interactive shell environment.
Other session-directory environment variables are not copied into the unit
either; put persistent settings in `config.toml` before installing.

On headless Linux machines, `systemd --user` services stop at logout and do not
start at boot unless user lingering is enabled. If lingering is disabled,
`install` prints the exact `loginctl enable-linger "$USER"` command and offers
to run it.

### `agentsview pg serve`

Start a read-only web UI backed by PostgreSQL.

```bash
agentsview pg serve [flags]
```

| Flag                | Default     | Description                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--host`            | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address                                        |
| `--port`            | `8080`      | Explicit nonzero port must be free; `0` selects any |
| `--base-path`       |             | URL prefix for reverse-proxy subpath                |
| `--public-url`      |             | Browser URL, also added to trusted origins                  |
| `--public-origin`   |             | Trusted browser origin (repeatable/comma-separated) |
| `--public-port`     | URL port or `8443`      | Managed Caddy HTTP/HTTPS listener and URL port                     |
| `--proxy`           |             | Managed proxy mode (`caddy`)                        |
| `--caddy-bin`       | `caddy`     | Caddy binary path                                   |
| `--proxy-bind-host` | `127.0.0.1`   | Caddy bind address                                  |
| `--tls-cert`        |             | TLS certificate path                                |
| `--tls-key`         |             | TLS key path                                        |
| `--allowed-subnet`  |             | CIDR allowlist (repeatable/comma-separated)         |

The normal session server is read-only: session uploads, file watching, and
local sync are disabled. Sessions from all machines appear in a single unified
view. The same deployment also serves the analytics dashboard and the Usage page
from PostgreSQL-backed queries.

When the PostgreSQL role can write the raw-sync tables and ingest-job sequence,
`pg serve` also registers the
[hosted raw-sync control plane](/docs/hosted-raw-sync/#http-control-plane).
Those routes can write raw custody metadata and local raw-sync storage, but they
do not make the session APIs writable. A PostgreSQL role without the required
raw-sync write privileges omits the runtime routes and logs the missing
requirements. Existing least-privilege raw-sync roles now also need `SELECT` and
`UPDATE` on `raw_ingest_jobs` so manifest commits can retire obsolete parse jobs:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON agentsview.raw_ingest_jobs TO raw_sync_runtime;
```

Run this as the schema owner, substitute your schema and runtime role, and
restart `pg serve`. Keep the existing `INSERT` and ingest-job sequence `USAGE`
grants. This enables the raw-sync HTTP routes; `pg serve` does not yet start the
internal parse worker or project hosted raw captures into browsable sessions.

On startup, `pg serve` automatically applies any pending schema migrations to
PostgreSQL, creating new tables and indexes added in newer AgentsView versions.
This removes the need to run `pg push` before starting the server after an
upgrade. If the PostgreSQL role is read-only, the migration is skipped and the
server falls back to the schema compatibility check.

When `require_auth` is enabled, a bearer token is generated if needed and
printed on startup. Pass it via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on API requests.
The SSE watch endpoint also accepts `?token=<token>` as a query parameter since
the `EventSource` API cannot set custom headers.

The raw-sync machine routes do not accept this shared bearer token. They use
their own device credentials and operation-scoped tokens as described in the
[hosted raw-sync security boundary](/docs/hosted-raw-sync/#security-and-deployment-boundary).

For LAN access, combine `require_auth = true` with a non-loopback bind such as
`agentsview pg serve --host 0.0.0.0`, or keep the backend on loopback and expose
it through a proxy.

`pg serve` does **not** expose the global live-refresh event stream used by
normal `agentsview serve`, because there is no local sync engine attached to the
server. The session browser, analytics, and usage views still work normally;
they are just not auto-refreshed by the global SSE path.

As of 0.33.0, the web UI distinguishes a **degraded backend** (the server
responds but PostgreSQL is temporarily unavailable, surfacing as 5xx errors)
from an unreachable one. Instead of forcing a page reload — which could loop
while the database was down — the app stays interactive with its current data,
shows a compact warning in the status bar, and clears it once a real data read
succeeds. Click the status bar to retry immediately. True network failures still
use the reload-based recovery path.

CockroachDB also works as the shared database. 0.33.0 reworked the analytics and
usage queries to perform well on CockroachDB (filter pushdown into the source
tables, SQL-side tool-call aggregation, batched pricing writes) without changing
any report semantics on PostgreSQL or SQLite.

In a multi-tenant deployment behind PostgreSQL row-level security, slow
analytics or usage panels usually point at the policy shape rather than at
agentsview itself. The read-side queries are already session-id-shaped, so
expose child rows through a set-based predicate such as
`session_id IN (SELECT ...)`, not a per-row `SECURITY DEFINER` call that runs
once per scanned row. If shared-dataset aggregates still need more time, raise
the API deadline with `--write-timeout`; the
[Remote Access](/docs/remote-access/#slow-aggregates-behind-a-proxy) page covers
the flag and the larger troubleshooting path.

When a reverse proxy reaches the backend by an internal hostname or service
name, keep `--public-url` on the browser origin and add the proxy's upstream
origin with `--public-origin`. The forwarded-access contract and troubleshooting
details live in
[Remote Access](/docs/remote-access/#public-url-and-trusted-origins).

!!! warning

    Query-parameter tokens can leak through server logs, browser history, and
    Referer headers. Prefer the `Authorization` header for all non-SSE requests, and
    use TLS (via managed Caddy or an external reverse proxy) to protect tokens in
    transit.

For managed Caddy mode, keep the backend `--host` on loopback and use
`--proxy-bind-host` / `--public-port` to expose the public listener. The
`pg serve` and normal `serve` modes keep separate managed-Caddy state, so both
can coexist on one host.

**Examples:**

!!! warning "Enable auth before exposing `pg serve`"

    Only the loopback example below is safe without auth. Every other example binds
    off `127.0.0.1` or fronts a public proxy, so set `require_auth = true` in
    `~/.agentsview/config.toml` before starting the server. The same bearer-token
    mechanism described in [Remote Access](/docs/remote-access/#authentication)
    applies.

```bash
# Local development — loopback, no auth required
agentsview pg serve

# Team viewer with managed Caddy and TLS
# Requires require_auth = true in config.toml
agentsview pg serve \
  --proxy caddy \
  --public-url https://viewer.example.com \
  --public-port 8443 \
  --tls-cert /path/to/cert.pem \
  --tls-key /path/to/key.pem

# Remote access on a trusted private network (no TLS)
# Requires require_auth = true; only use behind a VPN or on a
# private LAN because tokens cross the wire in cleartext.
agentsview pg serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# External reverse proxy under a subpath; the browser origin
# and the proxy's upstream origin are different.
agentsview pg serve \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --base-path /agentsview \
  --public-url https://console.example.com \
  --public-origin http://agentsview:8080
```

## Machine Labels

Each session keeps its source installation ID. The web UI uses display labels
for readability; set `local_machine_name` in the source's `config.toml`, restart
the daemon, and push again to change the label. Use the multi-host filter in the
sidebar to show sessions from specific machines.

The [installation upgrade](/docs/configuration/#upgrading-historical-machine-keys)
moves historical local sessions to their installation ID in SQLite. The next
incremental PostgreSQL push republishes those sessions and their metadata. It
also copies adopted hostname aliases, so existing machine filters and URLs keep
working. If two installations publish the same old hostname alias, the latest
push determines its filter target. Use installation IDs to select machines
unambiguously in a shared mirror. Equal display labels do not merge machines.

![Machine labels on session items](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/machine-labels.png)

______________________________________________________________________

## Configuration

Single-target PostgreSQL settings can live in the legacy `[pg]` section of
`~/.agentsview/config.toml`:

```toml
[pg]
url = "postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=require"
schema = "agentsview"
allow_insecure = false
```

| Field              | Default      | Description                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`              | (required)   | PostgreSQL connection string                                           |
| `machine_name`     | Installation ID | Explicit machine key for legacy local-sentinel rows; new sessions retain their recorded installation ID |
| `schema`           | `agentsview` | PostgreSQL schema name                                                 |
| `allow_insecure`   | `false`      | Allow non-TLS connections to non-loopback hosts                        |
| `projects`         |              | Array of project names to include in push                              |
| `exclude_projects` |              | Array of project names to exclude from push                            |

To manage more than one PostgreSQL destination, define named `[pg.NAME]` blocks
and select the effective default target with `default_pg`:

```toml
default_pg = "work"

[pg.work]
url = "postgres://user:pass@work-db:5432/agentsview?sslmode=require"

[pg.archive]
url = "postgres://user:pass@archive-db:5432/agentsview?sslmode=require"
exclude_projects = ["scratch"]
```

`agentsview pg push` and `agentsview pg status` use the effective default target
when no target name is passed, accept one target name explicitly, and also
support `--all` for sequential multi-target runs. `agentsview pg push --watch`
follows the effective default target unless you pass one named target
explicitly. `agentsview pg serve` and `agentsview pg service` stay on the
effective default target in this release, and `--all --watch` is rejected.

!!! warning

    The `url` field is required for all `pg` commands. If it contains credentials,
    ensure `config.toml` has restricted file permissions (`0600`).

The connection string supports standard PostgreSQL parameters. Use
`sslmode=require` or `sslmode=verify-full` for remote databases. Only use
`sslmode=disable` for trusted local connections.

Environment variables in the URL are expanded using `${VAR}` syntax:

```toml
[pg]
url = "postgres://${PG_USER}:${PG_PASSWORD}@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=require"
```

### Environment Variables

PostgreSQL settings can also be configured via environment variables. In legacy
single-target mode they override the `[pg]` values. In named-target mode they
apply only to the effective default target:

| Variable                | Description                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `AGENTSVIEW_PG_URL`     | PostgreSQL connection URL          |
| `AGENTSVIEW_PG_MACHINE` | Machine name for push sync         |
| `AGENTSVIEW_PG_SCHEMA`  | Schema name (default `agentsview`) |

______________________________________________________________________

## Multi-Machine Workflow

A typical team setup:

1. **Each developer** configures `[pg]` in their local `config.toml`. The
   installation ID identifies their sessions; `local_machine_name` sets the
   display label
1. **Each developer** installs `agentsview pg service` or runs
   `agentsview pg push --watch` to sync their sessions
1. **One server** runs `agentsview pg serve` pointed at the shared PostgreSQL
   database
1. **The team** opens the shared dashboard to browse everyone's sessions,
   filtered by machine if needed

```bash
# Developer A's machine
agentsview pg service install

# Team server behind an external reverse proxy
agentsview pg serve \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --base-path /agentsview \
  --public-url https://console.example.com \
  --public-origin http://agentsview:8080
```

## Limitations

- **One-way sync** — sessions flow from SQLite to PostgreSQL only. Changes in
  PostgreSQL do not propagate back to local machines.
- **Permanent deletes not propagated** — sessions removed via `agentsview prune`
  are not deleted from PostgreSQL because the local rows no longer exist at
  push time. Use a direct SQL DELETE to clean up PostgreSQL if needed.
  Soft-deleted sessions (trash) sync correctly.
- **Schema compatibility** — `pg serve` automatically applies pending schema
  migrations on startup. If the PostgreSQL role lacks DDL permissions, run
  `agentsview pg push` from a machine with write access to update the schema.
- **Trigram index bloat on pre-0.33.0 schemas** — the content search index was
  created with GIN `fastupdate` on, which let a pending-insert list grow
  unbounded under continuous ingest. 0.33.0 creates the index with
  `fastupdate = off` and alters existing indexes automatically, which stops
  further growth — but space already consumed is only reclaimed by a one-time
  `REINDEX INDEX idx_messages_content_trgm;`.

Release notes for
[0.44.0](https://github.com/kenn-io/agentsview/releases/tag/v0.44.0).

## 0.44.0

<small>2026-09-21</small>

**New features**

- Filter searches by project and date directly in the command palette. Switch to
  All Projects without changing the sidebar, or choose relative, calendar, or
  custom dates.
- Open a session by ID or UUID with Ctrl/Cmd+G.
- Push your archive to ClickHouse with `agentsview clickhouse push`, then serve
  the read-only dashboard with `agentsview clickhouse serve`. Keep the copy
  current with `push --watch` or `clickhouse service`. Session edits remain in
  SQLite. Vector search and hosted raw sync are not included. See
  [ClickHouse Sync](/docs/clickhouse-sync/).
- Browse Cline CLI sessions with transcripts, token usage, costs, and remote
  sync. Teammate runs appear beneath their parent; continued runs remain
  separate sessions. Cline VS Code extension sessions are not included.
- Browse Charm Crush and Tencent CodeBuddy CN sessions with their recorded
  conversations and usage. Crush reports session totals without per-message
  token or cache breakdowns.
- Track Augure Code separately from Codex and resume sessions through the Augure
  CLI. Proprietary Augure models remain unpriced.
- Browse, search, and export Augure Desktop 3 beta sessions with recorded usage
  and cost information. Remote sync is not supported for this agent.
- Read DeepSeek Harness session formats through version 3, including compressed
  logs. AgentsView selects the newest supported generation and excludes
  inherited parent transcripts from child sessions.
- Resume Pi sessions from AgentsView or copy a complete `pi --session` command.
- Export changes to stored user and assistant messages with
  `export conversations changes`, then fetch selected text with
  `export conversations message`. Save a checkpoint to retrieve later
  additions, edits, and deletions, including from imported archives or
  sessions whose source files are gone. Only the latest message version is
  retained. After an archive rebuild, start a new export. See
  [Conversation Export](/docs/conversation-export/).
- Find the earliest recorded activity and latest complete reporting hour with
  `export range`.
- Generate and inspect Activity Insights from scripts with
  `agentsview insight generate`, `insight list`, and `insight get`.
- Query archived usage without refreshing source files with
  `session usage --no-sync`.
- Look up sessions by UUID through MCP `search_sessions`, including active
  sessions. MCP `search_content` also accepts `include_one_shot` and
  `include_automated` to include single-prompt runs and automated sessions.
- Require several literal terms within one user/assistant exchange when
  searching conversation history through MCP `search_content`. Exact session,
  branch, and current-session filters narrow recall before the result limit,
  and each response reports the effective search mode, scope, and default
  exclusions.
- Include transcript paths in session-list JSON with
  `session list --include-source`.
- Inspect hosted raw sync through `GET /api/v1/raw-sync/status`, which reports
  source versions, parse-job counts, active devices, and upload backlog.
- Choose Azerbaijani in language settings.
- Hide AgentsView from the macOS Dock and Cmd-Tab when its window is closed
  using a new tray option. The setting is off by default and persists across
  relaunches. The app also adds a standard Window menu.
- Preview a project mapping workspace in builds made with
  `VITE_PROJECT_MAPPING_WORKSPACE=true`. Review folder suggestions and session
  previews, filter by date, and correct individual sessions or whole groups.
  This workspace is disabled in default builds.

**Improvements**

- Session Vitals, the session timing view, separates measured tool execution
  from time that cannot be assigned to a phase. Activity rows link to the
  corresponding transcript entries; the view does not infer thinking or
  response-generation time.
- Export large session archives and multi-day digests with fewer repeated
  database reads.
- ClickHouse daily usage reports calculate totals in the database instead of
  transferring every usage event to AgentsView.
- Load Activity reports without scanning unrelated SQLite usage history.
- Startup sync and usage-cache backfills use less background CPU.
- Database upgrades show opening, schema, index, and migration progress before
  session syncing begins.
- Session list, detail, sync, and search JSON include browser links when
  connected to a server. MCP session results preserve those links.
- Session links give the provider and UUID separate URL segments, so replacing
  the UUID is easier. Existing encoded links still open.
- JSON output from `session list --json` and `usage daily --json --breakdown`
  includes machine labels. The Activity machine filter keeps friendly labels
  visible and adds a short ID only when labels collide.
- Failed pricing refreshes retry after about 1.5 hours, with increasing delays
  after further failures, instead of waiting a full day.
- Repeated requests for image files reuse cached data to reduce disk reads. The
  cache has size and age limits.
- Profile `export sessions`, `export hour`, `export day`, and `export digest`
  with `--cpuprofile`, `--memprofile`, and `--trace`.

**Improvements**

- The Activity report served from ClickHouse returns the same results with far
    less database work. Usage tokens are read from stored columns instead of
    parsed JSON, tool events are paired per session, and candidate sessions are
    sent once as native data. The first push or serve after upgrading fills the
    new derived tables before serving and resumes if interrupted; a read-only
    serve role reports the pending fill until a push with a capable role
    finishes it.

**Bug fixes**

- Devin usage totals no longer discard messages from different sessions that
  share the same message number. Startup corrects stored message identities
  and then runs the usual full resync.
- StepFun `step-5-preview` sessions receive cost estimates, including in
  existing archives without a resync.
- Codex prompts no longer mix user text with injected context. Startup resync
  refreshes affected text, previews, and message counts when source files
  remain available. Sessions whose sources are gone retain their archived
  content.
- Session previews skip complete leading injected-context blocks. WorkBuddy
  sessions also use their generated titles when present.
- `codex exec` sessions are classified as automated. Roborev-tagged sessions are
  identified as automated code reviews. Restart or run `agentsview sync` to
  update existing sessions.
- Grok child sessions appear beneath their spawning parent and count as subagent
  activity. Native Pi branches regain parent links when the parent session can
  be resolved.
- Older Piebald and Kilo databases import despite missing columns that
  previously caused discovery or parsing failures.
- Cursor IDE imports accept structured tool results, including object-valued
  `todo_write` results.
- VS Code Copilot assistant messages retain the model used for each request,
  including model changes within a session.
- Healthy archived sessions continue copying to PostgreSQL and DuckDB when
  daemon-managed incremental pushes encounter a local ingestion failure.
- Sync avoids repeatedly parsing unchanged malformed or missing source files
  where failure caching applies. Unrelated file events no longer bypass retry
  delays, and temporary lock-file changes no longer trigger session syncing.
- Configuration loading rejects unknown keys under `[vector]`, including
  misspelled or misplaced settings. Previously accepted configurations may now
  fail; correct or remove the named keys, even if vector search is disabled.
- An explicit nonzero `--port` fails when occupied instead of silently choosing
  another port. Updates preserve the explicit port choice.
- PostgreSQL and DuckDB servers mounted under `--base-path` are discoverable,
  and API requests retain the path prefix.
- Version-mismatch errors identify whether to restart the daemon or upgrade and
  restart a stale command or background service.
- Clicking the macOS Dock icon or activating AgentsView through Cmd-Tab restores
  a hidden main window.
- Copying a session's directory path works after the directory has been deleted.
- Quality-page excerpts preserve complete Unicode characters when shortened.
- Activity concurrency tooltips clear when the date changes or the report
  refreshes.
- The Analysis panel header stays on one line.
- ClickHouse analytics summaries return zeros when no sessions match, instead of
  failing the request.
- Remote ClickHouse URLs that skip TLS certificate checks (`skip_verify=true`)
  are rejected unless `allow_insecure` is set.

## 0.43.0

<small>2026-09-14</small>

**New features**

- Browse and search Tau, Evener v2, and Open Code Review sessions, including
    recorded reasoning, tool results, and token usage. Open Code Review also
    includes structured review comments and resume links.
- Import OpenCode 2.0 beta conversations while preserving history across
    upgrades. Tool results retain embedded images and files. PDFs remain
    available in raw results without a preview.
- View Cursor CLI subagent transcripts under the session that launched them,
    including transcripts imported from S3. Run `agentsview sync` to import
    existing children if you normally run only usage commands.
- Open desktop sessions through `agentsview://sessions/<session-id>` links. Add
    `?msg=<ordinal|last>` to jump to a message.
- Copy a supported remote session's resume command with "Copy command", then
    paste it into a shell on the machine that owns the transcript.
- Choose how much content to archive with `archive_content` in `config.toml`.
    `full` remains the default, `transcripts` omits tool inputs and outputs, and
    `usage` keeps accounting without conversation text. Apply stricter retention
    to existing data by restarting the daemon and running
    `agentsview sync --full`. Recovering removed content requires the source
    files.
- Choose Keep, Drop, or Offload for tool-result images in Settings. Offload
    stores supported images as separate assets while preserving local image
    access. Restart the daemon after changing the setting, and back up the asset
    directory with the archive.
- Preview and remove archived inline images in Settings, with project and date
    filters. Use `agentsview db migrate --images` to move images into separate
    assets instead of removing them.
- Reclaim unused archive space with `agentsview db compact`. Preview savings
    with `--dry-run` or retain the original with `--keep-backup`. To choose a
    staging directory with `--staging-dir`, stop the daemon first.
- Register additional Claude, Codex, and Pi home directories in Settings or
    configuration. Directory settings now use `[agents.<id>]` tables, and
    startup converts older keys automatically. Upgrade both HTTP sync peers
    together.
- Discover Pi sessions through `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` and
    `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`, locally and over SSH. `PI_DIR` retains
    priority.
- Search Chinese, Japanese, and Korean messages with optional SQLite CJK
    full-text search, installed through `make install-cjk-fts`. Chinese queries
    use word segmentation, while Japanese kana and Korean queries preserve
    character order and adjacency.
- Export usage grouped jointly by project, model, and agent with opt-in
    reporting schema 4. Select projects with `--project-key` and choose the
    activity interval with `--bucket`. Intervals must be whole-minute divisors
    of one hour; the default is `5m`. Exports include repository identity
    information. Schema 3 remains the default; integrations using schemas 1 or 2
    must update and refresh saved digests.
- Filter MCP `search_sessions` results by inclusive activity dates using
    `date_from` and `date_to`.
- Discover running HTTP MCP listeners with `agentsview mcp status --json`,
    including their bound ports, backend targets, and token-file paths.

**Improvements**

- In-session search reveals the selected text inside collapsed blocks and nested
    scroll panes. Counts and navigation follow the active filters, and a result
    list and overview show each match's location. The underlined `ab` toggle
    enables whole-word matching.

- Sync sessions faster by reusing Git repository lookups for repeated working
    directories within each sync operation. OpenCode and its Kilo and MiMoCode
    forks, Command Code, and Kiro CLI now respect disabled filesystem discovery
    during remote imports and capture. These sessions use recorded paths to name
    projects, so their project names may change when re-parsed. (#1759)

- Expand a **Cursor CLI** session in the sidebar to read the transcripts of the
    subagents it delegated to. Transcripts stored in a parent session's
    `subagents` directory are now discovered, synced, and linked to the
    delegating session, including from S3 roots. Cursor's `Subagent` tool call
    now counts as a Task call in transcripts and analytics, but it does not yet
    link to the child session inline. Existing archives re-parse on the next
    sync to apply the new category. A machine that only runs `agentsview usage`
    needs one `agentsview sync` to pick up subagent transcripts that already
    exist.

- Activity separates interactive conversations, subagents, and automated
    sessions across counts, minutes, costs, and badges. Its concurrency chart
    stacks their simultaneous activity in one bar per time interval.

- View recorded reasoning effort beside the model in Claude Code and Codex
    session headers. Upgrading resyncs existing sessions to populate it, which
    takes time on large archives.

- Adjust one Zoom preference through Appearance, desktop shortcuts, or the
    desktop status bar. Set `zoom_level` in `config.toml` to supply a default
    while preserving each client's local choice.

- Hide continuation, resume, interruption, and task-notification cards with the
    "System boundaries" block filter.

- Preserve tags, whitespace, and literal lines inside unknown XML blocks by
    enabling "Render unknown XML blocks as preformatted text" in Appearance.

- Read assistant reasoning and recorded timestamps in local Cursor CLI sessions
    when matching chat databases are available.

- Track exported sessions across database rebuilds with `archive_id`. Session
    exports also include `transcript_revision` and `local_modified_at` to
    distinguish corrections from session activity.

- Exclude specific sessions from content search with repeatable
    `--exclude-session` options.

- Keep configured remote-server commands in installed history-search skills
    across reinstalls.

- See preparation phases and elapsed time while `agentsview usage daily` builds
    its cache. Daily reports use saved archive data; run `agentsview sync` first
    to include new source changes.

- Load Activity reports and tool and skill analytics with less work on large
    archives. The first startup may take longer while the archive builds an
    index.

- Avoid storing a second copy of tool output when a call has one result event,
    reducing archive size and read work. Direct database readers should use
    `tool_result_events` for content previously duplicated in
    `tool_calls.result_content`. Existing archives resync, and PostgreSQL
    mirrors re-push each session once.

- Sync growing Codex and Claude sessions with less repeated parsing. Large
    imports retain less data in memory, and shared OpenCode databases allow more
    sessions to parse concurrently.

- Refresh the semantic search index after sync without rereading unrelated
    message content. Linux daemons using glibc also retain less memory during
    repeated queries.

- Recover disk space from inactive usage caches after upgrades without removing
    caches still in use.

- Reduce idle CPU use while usage caches fill on large archives by checking only
    the sessions in each batch.

- Explain missing database privileges at hosted raw-sync startup. Existing
    runtime roles also need `SELECT` and `UPDATE` on `raw_ingest_jobs`; see
    [Hosted Raw Sync](/docs/hosted-raw-sync/#http-control-plane). The internal
    parse worker still needs server startup and PostgreSQL output support before
    it can provide hosted browsing.

**Bug fixes**

- Session transcripts load again under `duckdb serve`, fixing blank transcripts
    in 0.42.0.

- Usage reports complete while live sessions continue writing. Summary,
    comparison, and top-session requests also allow longer cache preparation
    without the normal server timeout.

- Windows daily usage and activity reports use the correct local timezone
    instead of failing or applying the wrong calendar dates.

- Copilot usage includes observed per-call tokens before shutdown and known
    output tokens when shutdown summaries are absent. Overlapping store and
    transcript records no longer count the same output twice.

- Cost estimates recognize Codex `gpt-reserve` as GPT-5.6 Luna, apply Bedrock
    rates to Bedrock model names, and resolve Ollama Cloud tags to base-model
    prices. Existing custom overrides retain priority.

- Antigravity CLI usage keeps the recorded effort-qualified model for the
    observed experimental serving variant, preventing one model's accounting
    from splitting into separate entries.

- The Usage model picker and charts agree on visibility. Clicking a model hides
    it, and checking it restores it. Older inclusion-only `model` links no
    longer restrict the view.

- Focused mode preserves Codex and TraeX answers followed by tool calls. Claude
    task notifications and stop-hook feedback no longer split an exchange or
    turn progress updates into final answers.

- Filtered code blocks remain as expandable placeholders. Code-only messages
    stay visible, and each block retains rendering and raw copy when expanded.

- Retained tool-result images render inside formatted output instead of
    appearing as enormous text strings that overflow the pane.

- Keep the command palette open when text-selection drags end outside it.

- Search the archive with two-character Chinese, Japanese, and Korean queries
    instead of seeing only recent sessions.

- Generate reports and session analyses over HTTP outside localhost.

- Filter Recall's Generated insights by session agent without rejecting the
    request.

- Selective hybrid Recall searches return results instead of failing when
    project or working-directory filters reach the vector search limit.

- Ollama embedding recovery reloads a failing Metal runner before falling back
    to CPU.

- Cursor imports preserve legacy tool-result text and use recorded user-turn
    timestamps when available. Empty Cursor IDE database rows no longer abort
    the entire sync.

- Claude sessions use the latest generated title when no `/rename` is present.
    Explicit renames, including an empty clear, retain priority.

- Codex guardian review sessions appear under their parent thread. Forks of
    readable parents with no prompts no longer retry indefinitely.

- Update Hermes session activity times as messages arrive.

- Include Pi skill loads in Top Skills analytics.

- DeepSeek Harness v0 sessions accept valid compressed source-event ranges.

- Remote imports for OpenHands, OpenCode, Kilo, MiMoCode, Command Code, and Kiro
    derive project names from recorded paths instead of unrelated local
    repositories.

- Keep local history together across updates, restarts, and hostname changes
    with a saved installation ID. Saved hostname filters and URLs continue to
    resolve. Older archives without recorded ownership need
    `agentsview db adopt-machine` to select local history. Remove old `machine`
    values from local `session_sources` entries.

- Recover startup automatically from stale state left by a crashed startup
    process.

- Show a retryable not-found message for missing sessions instead of a blank
    pane.

- SQLite-backed sessions stop resyncing in a loop because of AgentsView's own
    database reads.

- Wait with visible status when the daemon is busy during local incremental
    sync. Canceling the wait leaves the existing work running.

- Keep redirected sync output readable without terminal control sequences.

- Position archive search snippets around the matching text.

- Keep remotely imported project names independent of local repositories when
    importing changed files, matching full-import behavior. (#1759)

- Generate insights and session analyses when opening AgentsView over HTTP
    outside localhost. Starting a report no longer requires a browser UUID API
    that is unavailable on those origins. (#1742)

- Show costs for OpenCode turns served through Ollama Cloud, such as
    `kimi-k2.7-code:cloud` or `gpt-oss:120b-cloud`, which previously showed as
    $0.00. Ollama bills these models per token at the upstream model's published
    rate, so a tagged name now uses the untagged model's catalog price when
    nothing matches the tagged name itself. Usage breakdowns keep the tagged
    name, local Ollama tags such as `:27b-mlx` or `:latest` stay unpriced, and
    cached usage totals recalculate on the next start.

- Show Bedrock costs for Codex turns reported as `openai.gpt-5.4`,
    `openai.gpt-5.6-luna`, `openai.gpt-5.6-terra`, and `openai.gpt-6-astra`,
    while keeping those names in usage breakdowns. Dated usage uses AWS rates
    from GenAI Prices when available, including Luna and Terra prices before the
    July 30 cut. Astra gains offline pricing at Bedrock rates. Full
    region-qualified catalog names retain their own pricing.

## 0.42.0

<small>2026-09-01</small>

**New features**

- Test continuous uploads of raw session files from several machines with
    `agentsview raw-sync watch`. Uploads resume after interruption and keep
    local checkpoints. This remains an operator-provisioned preview: device
    enrollment, server-side parsing, and server-owned embeddings are not
    available in this release. See [Hosted Raw Sync](/docs/hosted-raw-sync/) for
    its limits.
- Measure usage for one automated Claude or Codex run with
    `agentsview capture run`. The command preserves source files and the child
    process's exit status, then writes a versioned usage report. Recover an
    interrupted report with `agentsview capture report`.
- Browse sessions from **Cursor IDE** and **IcodeMate CLI**.
- Include Posit Assistant's background cache-warming and classifier requests in
    usage costs when its `usage-events.jsonl` file records them.
- Read more session formats from S3-compatible storage. Providers can now opt in
    beyond Claude and Codex; support still depends on whether each session fits
    in one object.
- Use the web interface in **Japanese**.
- Estimate costs for more models using OpenRouter's pricing catalog.
- Estimate historical costs using the rate in effect when each usage event
    occurred, when a dated catalog rate is available.
- Include session source paths in API responses with `include_source=true`.
    Responses omit those paths by default.
- Let Recall extraction continue past uncertain secret findings with
    `[recall.extract] candidate_findings = "allow"`. Definite findings still
    block extraction. The default `"block"` policy continues to block both
    classes. (#1404)

**Improvements**

- Get daily usage reports faster on large SQLite archives. A rebuildable cache
    keeps daily totals current. The first query after an install, upgrade, or
    cache deletion takes longer while the cache builds.
- Sync active OpenCode archives faster by parsing only changed sessions inside a
    shared database.
- Keep embedding builds running through temporary provider rate limits.
- Avoid oversized embedding requests by limiting batches by both token count and
    item count.
- Resize the analysis panel to give reports or transcripts more room.
- Require explicit consent before an upload replaces a session with a shorter
    copy.
- Continue syncing local and reachable sources when a configured HTTP host is
    offline.
- Choose remote sync targets more consistently for editor sessions.
- Keep container builds moving when a Debian mirror fails by spreading downloads
    across mirrors and switching mirrors on failure.
- Build from source with Go 1.27 or later. Serialized JSON now follows Go's JSON
    v2 behavior.

**Bug fixes**

- Keep archived sessions available after their source files disappear.
- Finish archive reconciliation when a source must wait for a later pass.
- Show progress while a full resync finishes its final archive work.
- Discover OpenCode channel databases.
- Recover working directories from older OpenCode project metadata.
- Recover Antigravity working directories, generation usage, and model effort.
- Group Antigravity sessions from multiple Git worktrees under one project.
- Read current Kiro CLI session layouts.
- Discover Qoder CN sessions.
- Skip incomplete Gemini sessions without failing the surrounding sync.
- Stop retrying Trae sessions already identified as using an unsupported
    encrypted format.
- Include Devin sessions in Usage reports.
- Apply the correct price to Claude one-hour cache writes.
- Count Posit Assistant cache-write tokens correctly.
- Preserve UTC offsets when reading older PostgreSQL timestamps.
- Restore Grok agent-minute totals in Activity.
- Classify Grok's non-interactive sessions as automated.
- Keep waiting for daemon readiness while startup progress advances, avoiding a
    false timeout.
- Keep transcript rows aligned after changing sort order.
- Send arrow-key navigation to the pane that has focus.
- Keep Usage project filters stable across updates.
- Stop password managers from treating the project picker as a credential field.

## 0.41.1

<small>2026-08-18</small>

**New features**

- Keep AgentsView running in the Windows system tray after closing its window.
    Use the tray to reopen or quit the app.

**Bug fixes**

- Keep oversized VS Code Copilot snapshots searchable and indexable.
- Return consistent daily usage totals regardless of how the database plans the
    query.
- Ignore invalid links that mark a session as its own subagent.

**Acknowledgements**

## 0.41.0

<small>2026-08-16</small>

**New features**

- Browse sessions from **DeepSeek Harness**, **TraeX (TRAE CLI 2.0)**,
    **Codebuff and Freebuff**, **Prime Agent**, and **Goose**. Each provider
    keeps the reasoning, tools, session relationships, usage, and costs its
    format records. Prime Agent also preserves Pi-family forks and usage from
    recursive language model calls.
- Import **Gemini Apps** activity from English Google Takeout exports with
    `agentsview import --type gemini-apps`. Each `Prompted` record becomes a
    one-turn session with its exported timezone preserved.
- Find **Qoder IDE** sessions in the platform-specific
    `SharedClientCache/cli/projects` store as well as legacy export directories.
- Generate insights through an OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint.
- Switch expanded tool results between raw text and rendered Markdown.
- Find model-written reports under **Recall → Generated insights** and
    rule-based findings on the separate **Quality** page.
- See how much Recall extraction has processed and manage the generations of
    extracted knowledge it stores.
- Keep Amp usage accurate across model switches by recording the model and token
    counts for each inference.
- See the cost of all delegated work in `agentsview session usage <id>`. Add
    `--own-only` to report only that session's direct usage.
- Read versioned JSON for shell prompts and status integrations with
    `agentsview usage statusline --json`.

**Improvements**

- Keep large Activity reports responsive by processing results in bounded pages
    and avoiding repeated scans of the same data.
- Load daily usage reports faster through narrower database queries.
- Find duplicate prompts faster using an index for comparisons.
- Transfer and parse only changed source files during HTTP sync.
- Use less CPU while idle. Set `disabled_agents` to stop scanning unused local
    sources while keeping their archived sessions. Restart the daemon after
    changing this setting.
- Avoid reparsing unchanged Claude and Codex sessions after a daemon restart.
- Keep startup work bounded on large archives so the daemon can become ready.
- See daemon identity, source coverage, and sync health in status output.
- Recover from invalid Ollama embedding responses on CPU systems by retrying
    through Ollama's native endpoint.

**Bug fixes**

- Show the correct working directory for Kimi sessions.
- Read older Zed thread schemas.
- Restore response items from current VS Code Copilot session files.
- Keep Codex tool output when parsing newly appended transcript content.
- Attach forked Codex turns to their actual parents.
- Avoid counting replayed Codex subagent usage twice.
- Stop repeatedly parsing titled Codex sessions when `session_index.jsonl` is
    missing.
- Remove duplicated history from backgrounded Claude sessions.
- Keep Claude editor context out of session previews.
- Remove stale Claude session rows when a complete parse confirms the source no
    longer contains them.
- Honor explicitly empty agent-directory arrays instead of restoring default
    discovery roots.
- Avoid macOS folder-permission prompts during Git discovery in Documents,
    Downloads, Desktop, iCloud Drive, and cloud-provider folders. Sessions there
    use their recorded paths to identify projects. Set `scan_protected_paths` to
    opt in to Git remote, worktree, and branch details in those folders.
- Keep OpenCode's shared session database from using up recursive file-watcher
    capacity.
- Return from a child session to its root without leaving an accidental filter
    active.
- Report failed interface actions as failures.
- Start reliably when IPv4 and IPv6 listeners encounter port collisions.
- Mark stalled synchronization as unhealthy.

## 0.40.1

<small>2026-08-04</small>

**Bug fixes**

- Keep Kimi Work token totals complete when protocol 1.4 writes a tool result
    before its usage record. Existing affected sessions are corrected on resync.
- Price Kimi Work's `k2d6-agent` model alias at K2.6 rates in SQLite,
    PostgreSQL, and DuckDB. Existing affected sessions are corrected on resync.
- Start `agentsview pg serve` successfully on PostgreSQL minor releases whose
    text slicing could fail during the startup audit. The audit now reads
    explicit UTF-8 byte prefixes from compressed session text.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Cafeynman](https://github.com/Cafeynman) for preserving Kimi Work

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.40.0

<small>2026-08-02</small>

**New features**

- Inspect known projects in the top-level **Data** workspace. Open their
    recorded folders, preview project reassignment across the archive, and
    manage worktree mappings for each machine.
- Browse extracted knowledge in the experimental **Recall corpus**. Filter by
    project, type, generation, or review state; check extraction coverage; and
    follow evidence links back to transcripts. Recall remains local and
    SQLite-only. See [Recall](/docs/recall/) for its limits.
- Exchange parsed sessions through a trusted shared folder with
    `agentsview sync --target`. Each archive tracks progress and imports
    revisions published by its peers. This early workflow is manual: it excludes
    raw provider files and mutable curation, and has no continuous scheduler or
    hosted transport. See [Artifact Folder Sync](/docs/artifact-sync/).
- Build reporting workflows with versioned `agentsview export hour`, `day`, and
    `digest` output. The JSON uses closed UTC hours and content digests, so
    clients can detect corrections and replace an affected hour's report.
- Label filesystem roots by source machine with `[[session_sources]]`. Sessions
    retain the label from their first import through local resync and PostgreSQL
    or DuckDB mirroring.
- Browse **Omnigent** SQLite conversations and **Kimi Work** desktop wire logs.
    Kimi Work sessions include usage metrics when the logs provide them.
- Choose the server-wide **Agentsview** or **Matplotlib** chart palette under
    **Settings > Appearance**.
- Preserve Claude Code's session kind (`sessionKind`) and prompt source
    (`promptSource`) in the archive and when exchanging artifacts.

**Improvements**

- Keep usage totals consistent across reports with shared aggregation rules.
- Avoid floating-point rounding in stored costs by using integer microdollars
    (millionths of a dollar). Human-facing tables still show dollars; versioned
    JSON reports use microdollar objects.
- Find language choices by their native names.
- Use Taiwan-specific terminology in Traditional Chinese (`zh-TW`).
- Reach settings through compact section navigation.
- Find the session-sidebar toggle beside the filters it affects.
- Read repository and worktree paths more easily, with clearer labels and a
    wider tooltip for long or mixed-direction paths.
- Keep Recall extraction API keys in named environment variables instead of
    `config.toml`.
- Keep the daemon's LiteLLM pricing catalog current with daily refreshes.
- Apply input-size pricing thresholds to each usage request before adding up
    costs.

**Bug fixes**

- Preserve nested subagent hierarchies by linking each subagent to the session
    that spawned it.
- Keep active Codex sessions current when sync must retry missing or stale
    source paths.
- Limit reconciliation, recovery polling, and remote sync to the provider roots
    selected for that operation.
- Preserve source-machine labels in DuckDB mirrors.
- Group sessions launched from Git worktrees under their repositories.
- Read Devin CLI timestamps as epoch seconds instead of milliseconds.
- Use Copilot execution events to measure tool duration.
- Include Mistral Vibe cache-hit tokens in usage statistics.
- Mark terminal API failures as errored outcomes.
- Expand a leading `~` in DuckDB mirror paths.
- Skip blank embedding inputs without reporting them as rejected records.
- Keep retrying active sessions when sync repeatedly finds stale source paths.

    workspaces; artifact publication, peer import, and folder transport;

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.39.0

<small>2026-07-27</small>

**New features**

- Browse sessions from **Poolside Agent CLI**, **RooCode**, the **Kilo
    (legacy)** VS Code extension, and **Trae**. Trae supports legacy inline
    messages; modern encrypted layouts receive an unsupported-format message.
- Turn selected sessions into searchable knowledge linked to transcript evidence
    with experimental **Recall extraction**. It offers opt-in scheduled
    local-model processing, generation management, evidence validation, and
    keyword, semantic, or combined search. A read-only evidence panel shows the
    source material. Recall remains local and SQLite-only; see
    [Recall](/docs/recall/) for its limits.
- Use the application in **French**.
- Set up semantic search from the command palette. Follow its configuration and
    restart steps, start an embedding build, and watch progress. The palette
    retries the query when the index is ready.
- Break down daily usage by machine with
    `agentsview usage daily --json --breakdown`.
- Include recorded subagent costs in the parent session's total.
- See repository and worktree context in **Session Vital Signs**.
- See session age in human-readable `agentsview session search` results.
- The experimental portable-session format and local store provide a foundation
    for archive exchange. This release has no user-facing import or export
    command for that format.

**Improvements**

- Keep background sync memory and work proportional to changed files and
    affected Gemini roots.
- Improve semantic matching with distinct embedding prefixes for queries and
    documents.
- Detect and repair invalid stored embedding vectors automatically.
- Update PostgreSQL vectors incrementally as sessions change.
- Start analysis **Calls** details collapsed.
- Label inline teammate messages distinctly.
- Give active attribution chart series stable, distinct colors.
- Preserve Claude session identity metadata.
- Include the recorded model in generated resume commands.
- Configure the API write timeout and get clearer details when a request times
    out.
- Rebuild a DuckDB mirror automatically when its project filters change, so its
    contents match the new scope. **`agentsview duckdb push` now writes only the
    local mirror file and rejects `[duckdb].url`.** `duckdb status` and
    `duckdb serve` can still read a remote Quack endpoint.

**Bug fixes**

- Apply session date filters correctly across browser time zones.
- Keep saved rolling date ranges current as time passes.
- Allow project selection when a project has an empty name.
- Preserve project names when opening sessions from search results.
- Mark failed and invalid OpenCode tool calls correctly.
- Use OpenCode's recorded session directory in preference to its project's
    worktree path.
- Read current Grok Build persistence formats.
- Include Grok usage from `updates.jsonl` and count each turn's usage instead of
    treating the final snapshot as the whole session.
- Use Copilot-reported billing as the authoritative session cost.
- Preserve remote Markdown export links.
- Keep legacy archives intact during schema repair.
- Report daemon startup progress until it is ready.
- Preserve detailed progress messages during a full resync.
- Use the correct default Poolside directory on Linux.
- Avoid discovering the same resolved Poolside target twice over SSH.
- Fail promptly when a remote DuckDB endpoint is unavailable, with actionable
    errors for unsupported URLs and incompatible remote schemas.

## 0.38.1

<small>2026-07-13</small>

**Bug fixes**

- Restore correct **parent-child lineage and titles for Codex subagent
    sessions**, including current multi-agent metadata and addressed agent
    messages. Opaque encrypted tool payloads remain excluded from transcripts
    and search.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for restoring Codex subagent
    lineage and titles and for release documentation.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.38.0

<small>2026-07-13</small>

**New features**

- Open local Codex threads in Codex Desktop and Claude workspaces in Claude Code
    through **desktop deep links**. On macOS, closing the desktop window now
    keeps AgentsView available from a menu-bar status item with actions to show
    the window, open logs, check for updates, and quit.
- Manage the writable SQLite daemon with
    **`agentsview daemon start|status|restart|stop`**. The commands use the
    effective `config.toml`, leave read-only PostgreSQL and DuckDB servers
    alone, and report startup state, URL, PID, live daemon version, and uptime.
- Store and review provenance-linked durable knowledge with experimental
    **Recall**. Recall supports lexical query and task briefs, exact
    transcript-evidence validation, host-owned review states, supersession,
    measurement events, dry-run extraction, and guarded reviewed imports.
- Search a shared PostgreSQL archive by meaning with pgvector-backed semantic
    and hybrid search. `pg push` copies changed chunks from the active local
    embedding generation, `pg serve` and `--pg` reads search a matching
    generation, and `pg vectors list|drop` manages stored generations.
- Choose **Semantic** and **Hybrid** modes from the web command palette
    alongside Full text search, with remembered mode selection and actionable
    index or configuration errors.
- Resume reading where you left off. The browser tracks transcript progress,
    marks sessions with new content, places a boundary at the first unread
    message, and supports `Shift+J`/`Shift+K` navigation between user prompts.
- Follow an active **embedding build** from Settings, including phase, model,
    dimensions, chunk progress, throughput, elapsed time, estimated completion,
    and local generations.
- Use `request_dimensions` with embedding models and endpoints that support
    **Matryoshka-reduced vectors**, keeping the requested dimension in the
    generation fingerprint and validating every response.
- Explore **skill usage trends** in Analytics by day, week, or month, with
    per-skill series controls.
- Browse **Grok Build** sessions with messages, thinking, tool calls, and usage
    when `chat_history.jsonl` and `signals.json` are available.
- Browse **ZCode** messages, thinking, tool calls, results, and usage from its
    local SQLite archive.
- Read version details from the stable v1 **`agentsview version --json`**
    contract.
- Export richer content-free session evidence as JSON or NDJSON with
    privacy-bounded project, repository, worktree, checkout, pricing, usage,
    cursor, and archive-generation evidence without transcript text. Releases
    0.38.0 and 0.38.1 mislabeled this incompatible shape as v1; current builds
    report it as v2.

**Improvements**

- Speed up configured HTTP **full remote syncs** by rebuilding local and remote
    sessions together with FTS suspended, while avoiding retransfers of
    unchanged files from manifest-capable remotes.
- Bound **passive daemon memory and background sync work** by changed paths and
    provider capabilities instead of repeatedly materializing archive-wide
    session state.
- Reuse JSONL reader workspaces, apply **Codex appends** incrementally, and
    update **Claude subagent linkage** incrementally to reduce parser and sync
    work on active transcripts.
- Let Analytics, Usage, Activity, Trends, and Insights date ranges be linked
    globally or controlled independently from Settings.
- Keep **`daemon restart` startup progress** attached to the terminal until the
    replacement daemon is ready, with periodic phase and elapsed-time updates
    during long migrations or initial syncs.

**Bug fixes**

- Keep Activity's calendar-relative views current when the local date changes
    without requiring a page refresh.
- Align `agentsview stats` session totals with the default visibility rules used
    by session lists, including one-shot, automated, child, and deleted
    sessions.
- Report the running daemon's **actual live version** in lifecycle status output
    instead of trusting a possibly stale runtime-record value.
- Recover safely when a writable daemon still owns the archive but its runtime
    record is missing, and surface runtime-record publication warnings in server
    logs.
- Retry desktop backend shutdown before installing an update, avoiding failed
    updates while the sidecar is still exiting.
- Replay replaced JSONL segments from **VS Code Copilot** instead of treating
    same-length splices as append-only transcript growth.
- Export only the requested **Hermes** session when one transcript file contains
    multiple sessions.
- Prevent missing hashed SPA assets from falling back to stale HTML content.
- Recognize trusted **Windows directory owners** correctly through the updated
    filesystem trust checks.

## 0.37.5

<small>2026-07-09</small>

**New features**

- Show richer Antigravity IDE sessions when **`agy-reader` trajectory sidecars**
    are available, while falling back to the existing heuristic decode when a
    sidecar is missing, malformed, or incomplete.

**Bug fixes**

- Identify locally ingested sessions by the machine's hostname instead of the
    ambiguous `local` label, and keep full-rebuild safety independent when a
    configured remote has the same hostname as the collector.

- Remove **recommended-plugin context injected into Codex sessions** from parsed
    transcripts so it no longer appears as user-authored content.

- Include **overnight session activity** in date-filtered results by matching
    dates against session activity windows instead of only session start dates.

**Acknowledgements**

    filtering, overnight date-filter support, and release documentation.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.37.4

<small>2026-07-09</small>

**New features**

- Transfer only changed remote files after the first HTTP sync. The collector
    compares a remote manifest with a persistent per-host mirror and requests
    only changed files when fewer than half need fetching. Deleted remote files
    leave the mirror without deleting sessions already stored in the archive.

**Improvements**

- Include **GPT-5.6 model pricing** for the base alias and the Sol, Terra, and
    Luna variants in the embedded fallback catalog, so fresh installs and
    offline usage reports can estimate their costs without a network fetch.
- Explain **default `session list` exclusions** on stderr when one-shot or
    automated sessions are hidden, including the number in each category and the
    flags that include them. Structured stdout remains unchanged for scripts.

## 0.37.3

<small>2026-07-09</small>

**Bug fixes**

- Restore **optimized SQLite builds for Linux release binaries and Docker
    images** by preserving Go's default `-O2 -g` cgo flags when overriding
    `CGO_CFLAGS`, improving full-text search and query performance in those
    artifacts.

    release and Docker SQLite builds.

## 0.37.2

<small>2026-07-08</small>

**Improvements**

- Speed up **periodic syncs for unchanged OpenCode-family SQLite containers**.
    Once a full pass has verified every session in a shared OpenCode-format
    SQLite database, later idle passes can skip the container before per-session
    fingerprinting by comparing SQLite write markers for the database and WAL.
- Reduce **heap retention after large sync backfills** by periodically returning
    memory to the operating system while archived signal and secret
    recomputations walk large message and tool-result payloads.

**Bug fixes**

- Show **OpenCode tool-call skill names** in tool analytics by extracting the
    dedicated `skill` tool input and applying the existing `SKILL.md` inference
    heuristics to OpenCode read and shell calls.
- Shut down **watcher-triggered syncs** cleanly by threading the server run
    context through changed-path syncs, prioritizing watcher stop signals, and
    making unwatched-directory polling exit on cancellation.
- Fix **desktop app icon spacing** by insetting the shared icon artwork and
    regenerating the checked-in PNG, ICNS, and ICO assets.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for speeding
    up unchanged OpenCode-family SQLite container syncs.

## 0.37.1

<small>2026-07-08</small>

**New features**

- Find sessions by meaning with **semantic and hybrid search** backed by an
    opt-in local embeddings index. AgentsView embeds conversation units,
    supports `agentsview embeddings build|list|activate|retire`, adds
    `session search --semantic` and `--hybrid`, and returns citation ranges with
    lineage metadata for sidechain and subagent matches.
- Export content-free session summaries through a v1 JSON/NDJSON contract.
    `agentsview export sessions` emits session metadata, usage totals, pricing
    provenance, project identity, stable cursors, and reset errors without
    transcript text.
- Analyze one session from its header and store the report with other insights.
    The analysis uses that session's messages, timing, and usage.
- Browse **Posit Assistant, Windsurf workspace chat, Qoder, and ZCode
    sessions**. These providers cover Posit Assistant workspace conversations,
    Windsurf `workspaceStorage` chat state, Qoder project transcripts and
    sidecars, and ZCode's local SQLite session database.
- Use the application in **Korean (`ko`)**, alongside English, Simplified
    Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.
- Render **Mermaid fenced code blocks** in markdown messages while keeping the
    source readable if the Mermaid runtime cannot load.
- Show **session context and detailed token breakdowns** in usage views,
    including session-level output-token and peak-context details.
- Copy tool input and output separately with **tool-block copy buttons**.
- Map sessions back to repositories with **worktree layout mappings** in
    Settings. Use explicit path-prefix mappings or the `repo_dot_worktrees`
    layout for paths like `<prefix>/<repo>.worktrees/<branch>/...`.
- Limit local ingestion to approved working-directory prefixes with
    **`sync_include_cwd_prefixes`** in `config.toml`, so sync can ingest only
    sessions whose working directory falls under an allowed path prefix.

**Improvements**

- Render **CLI session search results as an aligned table** for the default
    no-context human output, with terminal-width-aware truncation.
- Reduce **push sync churn** by ignoring volatile stat fields when deciding
    PostgreSQL push candidates and by lowering DuckDB write amplification.
- Keep **unchanged OpenCode-family container sessions** out of sync updates, so
    container rows that did not change no longer churn during sync.

**Bug fixes**

- Parse **Codex custom tool calls** correctly so custom tool invocations are
    preserved as tool blocks instead of falling through malformed paths.
- Apply **`config.toml` port settings** to the active server config before
    startup, so configured ports affect the runtime server just like CLI flags.
- Preserve **calendar range picker selections** after range changes in the
    frontend.
- Apply **agent exclusions consistently in usage filters**, including Usage API
    and frontend paths that previously missed the exclusion set.
- Include **subagent sessions in activity report cost totals**, matching the
    session rows that contribute to the report.
- Map **OhMyPi `parentSession` headers** to `parent_session_id`, preserving
    parent-child lineage for OMP transcripts.
- Skip **local git discovery for sessions from other machines**, avoiding
    host-local repository probes for synced foreign-machine sessions.
- Fix **Linux release builds** by compiling the sqlite-vec cgo bindings against
    the SQLite header bundled with `mattn/go-sqlite3`. This is why the release
    ships as 0.37.1: the 0.37.0 tag never produced binaries.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.36.1

<small>2026-07-03</small>

**New features**

- Browse **Devin CLI sessions**. AgentsView discovers Devin CLI roots, reads
    local session data from the `cli/` subtree, parses Devin messages and tool
    activity, includes Devin in supported-agent metadata, and documents the safe
    root to share when filing bug reports.
- Get accurate **`parse-diff` diagnostics** for sessions last written through
    the incremental-append path. These rows are now classified as
    `incremental_skew`, excluded from `--fail-on-change`, and accompanied by
    guidance to run a full resync for a clean parser-drift baseline.
- Report **Antigravity `gen_metadata` without usage anomalies** in sync
    summaries, so operators can spot Antigravity records that contain generation
    metadata but did not produce normalized usage totals.

**Improvements**

- Show clearer **startup and resync state** while AgentsView initializes.
    Background startup now publishes the daemon PID, elapsed time, current
    phase, progress detail, and log path for `agentsview serve status`, while
    full resyncs print durable phase and completion lines.
- Improve **remote sync configuration and error reporting**. HTTP remote sync
    now validates configured hosts more directly, keeps ad hoc HTTP remotes
    unsupported, and maps common failures such as token rejection, missing
    remote endpoints, connection refusal, DNS failures, and timeouts to
    actionable messages.
- Refresh **frontend controls and dialogs** by migrating the Svelte UI to the
    shared `@kenn-io/kit-ui` components, making filters, range pickers, dialogs,
    settings controls, copy buttons, refresh controls, and related interaction
    states more consistent across pages.

**Bug fixes**

- Discover **OhMyPi sessions with a leading title slot**, matching the current
    OMP/Pi-style transcript shape instead of skipping those files.
- Reparse **in-place Claude rewrites** even when the source file size and mtime
    are unchanged, so same-length edits no longer leave stale stored messages.
- Fix **data-version resync completion** so preserved orphaned sessions and
    sessions copied through an aborted-resync fallback still receive the
    backfills they need instead of being treated as fully rewritten.
- Scope **PostgreSQL session-alias backfill markers per push target**, so one
    PostgreSQL destination cannot incorrectly satisfy or block the required full
    alias backfill for another target.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.36.0

<small>2026-07-02</small>

**New features**

- Compare the cost of any two project or model slices from the Usage page or
    API. The comparison uses the current date and filter window, and reports
    cost, sessions, tokens, per-session averages, and absolute and percentage
    changes. The REST endpoint is `GET /api/v1/usage/pairwise-comparison`.
- See a **malformed-line badge** when AgentsView recovered a session but skipped
    malformed source lines. The persisted `parser_malformed_lines` count makes
    partially recovered transcripts visible without opening CLI sync logs.
- Use the application in **Traditional Chinese (`zh-TW`)**, alongside English
    and Simplified Chinese.
- Fork a **Claude session from any selected message**. Claude message headers
    now expose a fork action that renders the transcript through the selected
    ordinal into a temporary prompt and launches `claude` from the session
    working directory, or returns a copyable command when launch is not
    available.
- Filter sessions, search, analytics, activity, and usage by Git branch. The
    `GET /api/v1/branches` endpoint returns distinct `(project, branch)` pairs
    with opaque filter tokens, and session, search, analytics, activity, and
    usage endpoints accept those tokens as `git_branch`. Project-scoped tokens
    keep same-named branches in different repositories distinct and preserve
    empty branch values.
- See an **Unverified schema** badge when an Antigravity session came from an
    unrecognized schema. Antigravity IDE and CLI parsers fingerprint SQLite
    schemas into `source_version`; unknown fingerprints get an
    `agy-schema:<prefix>` marker, session details expose
    `decode_confidence: "low"`, sync summaries count the affected sessions,
    `doctor sync` reports them, and the UI shows an **Unverified schema** badge.

**Improvements**

- Improve **Cursor attribution in stats** so `agentsview stats` and the stats
    service read the host-local Cursor attribution database with parity between
    direct and daemon-backed execution. Cursor attribution remains machine-local
    and reports unsupported project filters explicitly.
- Extend **`parse-diff` coverage** to DB-backed Warp, Forge, and Piebald
    sessions by allowing provider-authoritative sources, not only file-backed
    parsers.
- Reduce **daemon sync CPU usage while sessions are actively streaming** by
    avoiding repeated skip-check work on hot files that are still being written.
- Improve **unsupported usage reporting** from agent capabilities. Agents now
    advertise whether they lack per-message token data and whether their costs
    are denominated in AI credits (surfaced as "Copilot AI Credits" for Copilot
    agents) as separate capabilities, so Copilot-family filters keep
    Copilot-specific wording while other no-token agents get generic guidance.
- Publish a **`stable` Docker image tag** on tagged releases. `stable` always
    points at the most recent tagged release, while `latest` continues to track
    `main` and exact version tags remain immutable.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix **DuckDB push schema setup through Quack** so remote Quack-backed pushes
    initialize and validate the DuckDB schema correctly.
- Fix **Visual Studio 2026 Copilot session parsing** for the current trace
    layout while preserving the existing Visual Studio Copilot agent identity
    and discovery paths.
- Surface **unsupported Copilot usage filters** correctly in the Usage page and
    API instead of showing an empty report without the Copilot no-token-data
    note.
- Backfill **worktree mappings** for sessions that have empty working-directory
    rows but can be matched from sibling sessions under the same mapping.
- Prevent **OpenCode WAL watcher feedback loops** by reading OpenCode-family
    SQLite databases through read-only file URIs, ignoring transient `-shm`
    events, and only treating main database or data-bearing WAL changes as
    meaningful.
- Remove **outdated Copilot billing wording** from CLI usage output. The note
    now says Copilot records do not include token or cost data AgentsView can
    total, rather than referring to old billing terminology.

## 0.35.2

<small>2026-06-30</small>

**Bug fixes**

- Fix **PostgreSQL push sync** so skipped ownership conflicts no longer block
    the session-alias backfill marker.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [leejuhanKr](https://github.com/leejuhanKr) for fixing PostgreSQL
    push sync behavior around skipped ownership conflicts.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.35.1

<small>2026-06-30</small>

**New features**

- Add **OpenClaude session support** so AgentsView can discover, import, and
    display OpenClaude JSONL sessions alongside Claude Code and other local
    agents.
- Add **Copilot CLI usage guidance** for records that include aggregate usage
    metadata but do not include per-message token counts.

**Improvements**

- Reuse the configured **DuckDB mirror path** for Quack sync so `duckdb push`,
    `duckdb status`, `duckdb serve`, and `duckdb quack serve` stay pointed at
    the same mirror by default.
- Improve **DuckDB and Quack sync behavior and coverage**.

**Bug fixes**

- Require **daemon transport** for CLI read commands that depend on
    daemon-backed data.
- Surface **desktop backend startup failures** clearly instead of hiding the
    underlying error.
- Validate **desktop updater signatures** before applying updates.

    daemon-transport requirement on CLI read commands.
- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for desktop backend error
    surfacing, desktop updater signature validation, and release documentation.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.35.0

<small>2026-06-29</small>

**New features**

- Add **HTTP daemon remote sync** so configured remote hosts can sync through
    the local daemon instead of requiring each CLI invocation to perform the
    work directly.
- Add **PostgreSQL serve support for curation and insights**.
    `agentsview pg serve` can now back starred, trashed, renamed, and insight
    workflows from the shared PostgreSQL store.

    search sessions, inspect message windows, and summarize usage from the
    AgentsView archive. See [MCP Server](/docs/mcp/).
- Add **Recent Edits**, a top-level feed for reviewing file edits across
    sessions and jumping back to the exact message that made each change. See
    [Recent Edits](/docs/recent-edits/).
- Add **batch session selection and deletion** in the sidebar.
- Add **S3-compatible object storage discovery** for Claude and Codex session
    roots, so a central AgentsView instance can sync raw session files from S3,
    MinIO, R2, OSS, and similar stores. See
    [S3-Compatible Session Sources](/docs/configuration/#s3-compatible-session-sources).
- Add **Chinese localization** plus language settings across the frontend.
- Add **UI text-size scaling** and **high-contrast** appearance mode.
- Add an **Analytics dashboard model filter** that scopes dashboard panels to
    selected models. See [Model Filter](/docs/usage/#model-filter).

- Add **IcodeMate** agent support.
- Add **Cursor admin usage ingestion** to the Usage board.
- Add **Kimi cost estimation** from aggregate token usage.
- Add **per-remote sync intervals** for configured remote hosts.
- Add **named PostgreSQL push targets** so separate destinations can keep their
    own connection and watermark state.
- Add **offline LiteLLM pricing fallback data** for usage and cost reporting.

**Improvements**

- Make **local CLI and desktop workflows daemon-first**, aligning commands with
    the long-running local service used by the desktop app.
- Standardize **`--format` and `--json` output flags** across commands.
- Surface **parser anomaly signals** in sync summaries so malformed or
    suspicious parser output is easier to notice.
- Stream **remote sync progress through the daemon** with per-phase elapsed
    time.
- Improve **daemon replacement handling** for `agentsview serve`.
- Preserve **Pi message tree lineage**.
- Preserve **XML-style prompt tags** in rendered markdown.
- Show **summary-mode Antigravity CLI sessions** and record Antigravity
    producing-version metadata.
- Enrich **tool summaries** and add a **skim layout** for session reading.
- Add an **in-page help affordance** for Insights.
- Add **right-side axis labels** to the concurrency timeline.
- Require **opt-in Aider discovery** to avoid scanning large or sensitive
    directory trees unexpectedly.
- Add `substrings` and `exact_matches` to **automated session detection**
    configuration.
- Publish **raw markdown route companions** for docs pages.
- Deprecate **Amp support documentation** now that current Amp releases may keep
    complete threads server-side.

**Bug fixes**

- Include **Claude.ai export attachments** during import.
- Honor **`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`** for Claude session discovery.
- Support **explicit WSL paths** in desktop environment settings.
- Persist **desktop sidecar logs** for desktop builds.
- Use **native webview zoom** in the desktop app, fixing Windows zoom rendering.
- Repair the **AppImage DirIcon** after bundling.

    elapsed time.
- Fix a **resync discovery performance regression** and correct its
    mis-attributed phase timing.
- Detect **Codex title-only renames** during full sync.
- Repair **persisted Codex goal-context rows**.
- Treat Codex **`/goal` continuation context** as system content.
- Fix **Gemini per-turn context token** calculation.
- Fix **Gemini insight generation** by no longer forcing a sandboxed Gemini CLI
    run.
- Count **subagent sessions** in analytics totals.
- Clamp **analytics top-session active duration** by idle gaps.
- Scope **filtered PostgreSQL push watermarks** correctly.
- Reset **push watermarks** when PostgreSQL targets change.
- Fail **blocked PostgreSQL pushes** and surface push errors.
- Accept duration syntax for **`usage daily --since` and `--until`**.
- Deduplicate **replayed continued-session usage rows**.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.34.1

<small>2026-06-21</small>

**New features**

- Add the **AgentsView documentation site**, including quickstart, commands,
    configuration, usage, stats, token usage, API, remote access, and PostgreSQL
    sync docs.
- Add **documentation build and deployment support**, including validation,

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.34.0

<small>2026-06-20</small>

**New features**

- Add the **Activity** reporting dashboard. The new top-level page reports
    active time, idle time, peak concurrency, agent-minutes, cost, output
    tokens, projects, models, machine filters, automation filters, clickable
    concurrency buckets, session rows, project/model/agent breakdowns, and
    range-scoped Activity Insights. See [Activity](/docs/activity/).
- Add **session quality scoring and insight patterns**. Session intelligence now
    has a richer scoring basis for recurring quality patterns, and the Activity
    page can generate a daily or range activity insight for the currently
    resolved range.
- Add a **Top Skills** analytics panel that ranks skill-backed tool calls by
    call count, sessions, recency, agent mix, project mix, and weekly trend.
    Skill names come from explicit tool metadata and are inferred from
    `SKILL.md` reads for agents (such as Codex and Cursor) that do not record
    them. See [Top Skills](/docs/usage/#top-skills).
- Add new session sources: **OhMyPi**, **Reasonix**, **aider**, **Mistral
    Vibe**, **Visual Studio Copilot**, **Shelley**, **QwenPaw**, **MiMoCode**,
    **Claude Cowork** sessions from Claude Desktop local-agent mode, **Kilo**,
    **DeepSeek TUI**, and **gptme**. Each source has a matching environment
    variable and `config.toml` directory-array key. See
    [Session Discovery](/docs/configuration/#session-discovery).
- Add **background `serve` mode**. `agentsview serve --background` starts the
    web UI as a managed local service, writes logs to `~/.agentsview/serve.log`,
    and records enough runtime metadata for `agentsview serve status` and
    `agentsview serve stop` to inspect or stop the daemon later. See
    [CLI Reference](/docs/commands/#background-mode).
- Route `agentsview session` **read commands through PostgreSQL**. When
    `AGENTSVIEW_PG_URL` or `[pg].url` is configured, read-only session commands
    use the shared PostgreSQL store by default; pass `--pg` to require that path
    explicitly. Mutating commands continue to use the local archive.
- Target an **explicit session server** from the `agentsview session` CLI with
    `--server <url>`, authenticated by `AGENTSVIEW_SERVER_TOKEN` or
    `--server-token-file`; a discovered local daemon's token is never sent to an
    explicit URL. See [Session API](/docs/session-api/).
- Add **session list sorting** to CLI and HTTP surfaces with
    `agentsview session list --sort`, `--reverse`, `order_by`, `descending`, and
    per-key direction suffixes such as `messages:desc,started:asc`. See
    [Session API](/docs/session-api/#agentsview-session-list).
- Add `agentsview doctor sync`, a **sync diagnostics** report for checking
    database readability, data-version counts, agent roots, and recent
    sync-debug lines. See [CLI Reference](/docs/commands/#agentsview-doctor-sync).
- Add `agentsview parse-diff`, a parser QA report that re-parses source files
    from the current archive and reports differences from the stored SQLite rows
    without rewriting sessions. See
    [CLI Reference](/docs/commands/#agentsview-parse-diff).
- Surface **Copilot AI credits** in usage reporting when Copilot-family sessions
    have priced usage.
- Add **Copy source file path** to the session export menu when the active
    session has a backing source file.

**Improvements**

- Use one shared **range picker** and keep date ranges synchronized across the
    Analytics dashboard, Usage page, and Activity page.
- Improve **SQLite dashboard performance** by reducing heavy analytics refetches
    during sync, adding more deliberate freshness handling, improving large
    sidebar index loading, adding usage-query indexes, compressing API
    responses, and bounding WAL checkpoints.
- Batch **PostgreSQL push comparison reads** for faster sync.
- Preserve **source machine metadata** during PostgreSQL push instead of
    replacing it with the pushing machine.
- Persist **Codex and OpenCode working directories** so Git worktree mappings
    can classify more sessions by their real project root.
- Streamline the **Analytics and Usage refresh control**: a single refresh
    button paired with a relative "Updated…" timestamp, where a manual refresh
    also resets the automatic refresh timer.
- Show **agent-provided display names in the dashboard "Top sessions"** list
    instead of the first message, matching the session sidebar.
- Extract **token usage and cost from VS Code Copilot** sessions when their
    persisted request metadata includes `promptTokens`, `outputTokens`, and
    resolved model names. See
    [VS Code Copilot Token Metrics](/docs/token-usage/#vs-code-copilot-token-metrics).
- Improve **Antigravity** parsing: IDE role detection now recognizes newer step
    types, model-name extraction filters noisy prose and URLs, token extraction
    is more complete, and tool-call metadata is richer.
- Import **Codex renamed session titles** from `session_index.jsonl` and
    re-parse **Codex sessions when token counts arrive late**, so sidebar titles
    and usage rows catch up without a manual workaround.
- Promote **orphan subagent sessions** into sidebar roots instead of hiding them
    behind missing parents.
- Fill in **working directory metadata for Pi** sessions when the Pi transcript
    header provides it.
- Refresh frontend glyphs with **lucide icons**.
- Strengthen **selected session styling** in the sidebar so the active row
    remains visible across themes and agent colors.
- Improve **Activity refresh controls**, filter controls, selected sidebar rows,
    and read-only UI states.
- Advertise the WSL **`eth0` URL** when `agentsview serve --host 0.0.0.0` runs
    inside WSL and no explicit `--public-url` was supplied.
- Migrate frontend tooling to **Vite+** while preserving the existing Svelte app
    behavior.

**Bug fixes**

- Prevent **PostgreSQL push collisions** for same-ID sessions from different
    machines.
- Deduplicate **duplicate Claude sync sources** so the same transcript is not
    indexed from overlapping roots.
- Support the **Claude companion session layout**, including subagent parent
    inference from companion directories and externalized tool result content.
- Support the newer **`.kimi-code` session layout** and add **`.kimi_openclaw`**
    to OpenClaw's default discovery paths.
- Parse **OpenClaw and QClaw `toolCall`/`toolResult` blocks**, whose camelCase
    names the shared content extractor previously dropped, so tool calls and
    tool-only assistant turns no longer vanish from those transcripts.
- Render Cursor **`ApplyPatch` tool calls** as patch/diff content in the message
    viewer and markdown/export paths.
- Fix **nested fenced code block** parsing.
- Pin CSP resource origins to the configured **public origin**, fixing
    deployments behind a trusted public URL or proxy.
- Classify **single-turn automation from session transcripts**, not just the
    stored first-message preview, so automated review sessions are filtered
    correctly even when their preview is a generated title.
- Base **skill analytics** on message timestamps.
- Route **command palette session picks** correctly from non-session pages.
- Skip **local-only frontend calls in read-only mode**, including
    PostgreSQL-backed `pg serve` deployments.
- Tolerate **NULL message timestamps** in velocity analytics.
- Keep **usage chart date labels** within bounds.
- Show **hour-of-week heatmap** rows starting on Sunday.
- Use **`CREATE_NO_WINDOW`** for the Windows background daemon.
- Update **DOMPurify** for security.

## 0.33.1

<small>2026-06-12</small>

**New features**

- Show **user-assigned Pi session names**. The Pi parser now extracts names
    assigned with Pi's `/name` command, so those sessions appear in the sidebar
    under their given name alongside other agent-provided session names.

**Bug fixes**

- Stop **double-counting forked Codex sessions**. `codex fork` copies the
    parent's rollout history — session metadata, turns, messages, and token
    counts — into the top of the new file, and the parser counted that replayed
    prefix as the fork's own activity, billing the shared history in both the
    parent and the fork; the replayed parent metadata could also overwrite the
    fork's session ID, storing the fork under the parent's identity. Forked
    sessions now skip the replayed history and keep their own identity.
- Render **tool call groups** reliably when message identifiers repeat. Sessions
    read through the [PostgreSQL backend](/docs/pg-sync/)'s `pg serve` leave
    message IDs unset (its messages table keys on session and ordinal), so a
    tool call group holding more than one message produced duplicate render keys
    and tore down the message panel. Groups now key messages by their ordinal,
    which is unique within a session on every backend.

## 0.33.0

<small>2026-06-12</small>

**New features**

- Add a **DuckDB mirror backend** with Quack remote support.
    `agentsview duckdb push` mirrors the local SQLite archive into
    `~/.agentsview/sessions.duckdb`, `agentsview duckdb serve` runs the
    read-only web UI from that mirror, and `agentsview duckdb quack serve`
    exposes the mirror over DuckDB's Quack remote protocol so another machine
    can serve from it. SQLite remains the source of truth for ingestion — the
    mirror is one-way, like [PostgreSQL sync](/docs/pg-sync/). Configuration
    lives in a `[duckdb]` section of `config.toml`. See
    [DuckDB Mirror](/docs/duckdb/) for the full setup, including the Quack token
    and loopback safety defaults. The DuckDB driver is linked into every binary
    except `windows/arm64`, where the upstream bindings ship no prebuilt library
    — `agentsview duckdb` subcommands report a clear error there while everything
    SQLite-backed keeps working.
- Add **Command Code** session support. Sessions are discovered under
    `~/.commandcode/projects/` as one JSONL file per session, with an optional
    `.meta.json` sidecar for metadata; structured tool calls, tool results, and
    thinking blocks are parsed from the message content. Configure custom paths
    with `COMMANDCODE_PROJECTS_DIR` or `commandcode_project_dirs`. See
    [Session Discovery](/docs/configuration/#session-discovery).
- Add **Zed** AI assistant session support. AgentsView reads Zed's
    `threads/threads.db` SQLite database from the platform data directory
    (`~/Library/Application Support/Zed` on macOS, `~/.local/share/zed` on
    Linux, `~/AppData/Local/Zed` on Windows), extracting messages, model names,
    and per-request token usage, so Zed sessions also contribute to
    [usage and cost reports](/docs/token-usage/). Configure custom paths with
    `ZED_DIR` or `zed_dirs`.
- Allow publishing sessions as **secret GitHub gists**. The publish button in
    the session header is now a dropdown with **Publish public Gist** and
    **Publish secret Gist** entries, backed by an optional `secret` parameter on
    the publish endpoint. Note that secret gists are unlisted, not
    access-controlled — anyone with the URL can read them. The `p` shortcut
    still publishes publicly. See [Publish to Gist](/docs/usage/#publish-to-gist).
- Ship **native Windows ARM64 builds**: release archives now include a native
    `windows_arm64` binary (built with the aarch64 llvm-mingw toolchain, with
    full CGO/FTS5 support) and PyPI gains a `win_arm64` wheel. The PowerShell
    installer prefers the native build automatically. See
    [Quick Start](/docs/quickstart/#install).
- Add **configurable remote hosts** for
    [`agentsview sync`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-sync). Declare a fleet of
    machines as `[[remote_hosts]]` entries in `config.toml` (each with `host`
    and optional `user` / `port`) and a bare `agentsview sync` runs the local
    sync, then syncs every configured host over SSH in order. Failed hosts are
    reported and skipped rather than aborting the run; `sync --host X` continues
    to ignore the configured list.
- Show the **session cost** in the session header. Next to the token summary,
    the header now displays the estimated cost of the open session (`<$0.01`
    floor, two decimals up to $100, whole dollars above), computed from the same
    per-session usage endpoint that powers `agentsview session usage`. The badge
    is hidden when the session has no token data or its models have no pricing.
- Add **syntax highlighting** for fenced code blocks, powered by Shiki. Twelve
    common languages are bundled (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Bash, JSON,
    YAML, Markdown, HTML, CSS, Rust, Go, SQL); unlabeled or unknown languages
    render as plain text. Highlighting is skipped for blocks over 50 KB or 800
    lines to keep large sessions fast, and the highlighter loads lazily in
    code-split chunks so it costs nothing until the first code fence renders.
    See [Code Blocks](/docs/usage/#code-blocks).

**Improvements**

- Show **agent-provided session names** in the sidebar. Several agents record a
    session title (Claude Code's `/rename`, Claude.ai and ChatGPT conversation
    names, Forge, Hermes, Kiro, Piebald, Cortex Code, and Command Code's
    `.meta.json` titles); the session list now shows these titles instead of the
    first-message preview. Manual in-app renames always win and are never
    overwritten by agent-provided names. The release bumps the parser data
    version, so existing sessions backfill their names on the next resync.
- Leave **session labels** untruncated. Sidebar labels were hard-truncated at 50
    characters; the full label is now placed in the DOM and CSS ellipsis
    clipping adapts to the actual sidebar width instead of a fixed character
    count.
- Extract **Antigravity CLI token usage**. The parser now reads token counts
    from trajectory `gen_metadata` blobs and from sidecar `generatorMetadata`
    arrays, with precedence rules that prevent double-counting, so Antigravity
    CLI sessions contribute to the
    [Usage dashboard](/docs/token-usage/#usage-dashboard) and `agentsview usage`
    after the 0.33.0 resync.
- Prefer **agy-reader trajectory sidecars** when they are at least as complete
    as the raw Antigravity CLI source: for SQLite sessions the richer source
    wins by step count, and for encrypted `.pb` sessions the sidecar is used
    whenever present.
- Infer the **Antigravity CLI project** when `history.jsonl` rows lack a
    conversation ID, by matching the conversation's first user prompt against
    history entries — previously those sessions grouped under `unknown`.
- Discover **nested Claude workflow subagents**. Subagent transcripts written
    under nested `subagents/` paths (as produced by workflow orchestration) are
    now found by a recursive walk instead of a flat directory listing, so they
    appear in the [sub-agent tree](/docs/usage/#sub-agent-tree).
- Keep the app usable when the **PostgreSQL sync backend is degraded**. A 5xx
    from the backend no longer forces a full page reload (which could loop while
    the database was down) — the UI stays interactive with a compact status-bar
    warning, and recovers once a real data read succeeds. True network failures
    still use the reload-based recovery path.
- Improve **PostgreSQL and CockroachDB analytics performance**: usage-window
    queries push their filters down into the source tables, tool-call category
    aggregation moved from Go into SQL, and model-pricing writes are batched and
    skipped when unchanged. Aggregation semantics are unchanged across SQLite,
    PostgreSQL, and CockroachDB.
- Ship fallback pricing for **`claude-fable-5`** ($10 input,
    $50 output, $12.50 cache creation, $1 cache read per million tokens), so
    Fable 5 sessions are priced before the LiteLLM catalog catches up. See
    [Pricing Source](/docs/token-usage/#pricing-source).
- Fall back to the **system browser on Linux** when the desktop WebView cannot
    render. On GPU/driver/compositor combinations where WebKitGTK aborts with an
    EGL error and leaves a blank window, the desktop app now detects the dead
    WebView, opens the UI in your default browser, and explains what happened —
    the backend keeps running either way.
- Add **anonymous daemon telemetry**. The server now sends a daily liveness ping
    (version, commit, OS, architecture, and a random per-machine install ID — no
    session data, paths, hostnames, or prompts). Disable it with
    `AGENTSVIEW_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0`. See
    [Privacy and Telemetry](/docs/configuration/#privacy-and-telemetry).

**Bug fixes**

- Include **non-Claude agents** in the peak context token distribution. The
    stats bucketing was gated to Claude sessions even though other parsers
    (Hermes, Kimi, Forge, Zed) record peak context tokens; the gate now keys on
    whether the data exists.
- Create the PostgreSQL **content trigram index** with `fastupdate = off`. With
    the GIN default, continuous ingest buffered inserts into a pending list that
    only VACUUM merges, bloating the index by orders of magnitude on large
    archives. New indexes are created with `fastupdate = off` and existing ones
    are altered on startup; run `REINDEX INDEX idx_messages_content_trgm;` once
    to reclaim space already consumed.
- Fix the **Windows PowerShell 5.x installer**, which aborted with "maximum
    redirection count exceeded" while resolving the latest release; the
    installer now follows the redirect with a HEAD request that works on both
    PowerShell 5.x and 7+. On Windows ARM64 it also probes for the native
    `arm64` asset and falls back to `amd64` under emulation only when no native
    build exists.

## 0.32.1

<small>2026-06-05</small>

**New features**

- Show the **full content of tool calls** in the message viewer. Long tool
    parameters — Bash commands and heredocs, large `Write` payloads — were
    truncated at 200 characters with no way to reach the rest, even though the
    complete text was already stored. The collapsed
    [tool block](/docs/usage/#tool-blocks) now previews the first 20 lines with
    a *Show more* / *Show less* toggle, Bash calls render their `description`
    and `command` fields in full, content is capped at 200 lines to keep the DOM
    light, and a search match inside a collapsed block expands it automatically.

**Improvements**

- Skip **`/usage` probe sessions** from session lists and usage reporting.
    Content-free probes whose only real turn is the `/usage` command — such as
    CodexBar's ClaudeProbe, which runs `claude /usage` to read usage stats — are
    now dropped during parsing, while sessions that also contain a genuine
    prompt are kept.
- Recognize **Codex code-review sessions** as
    [automated activity](/docs/configuration/#automated-session-detection).
    Codex re-emits the initial prompt verbatim when it continues a task across
    turns, which pushed the user-message count past the single-turn gate and
    left review sessions (`"You are a code reviewer."` and
    `"You are a security code reviewer."`) unflagged. The parser now drops a
    verbatim replay of the first prompt until a distinct user turn appears, so
    these sessions classify as automated and stay out of session lists and
    analytics by default. Both this and the `/usage` skip ship with a
    `dataVersion` bump, so existing archives correct themselves on the next
    resync.

**Bug fixes**

- Resolve **dotted model names** to the dashed pricing-catalog keys so usage
    costs compute correctly. Some agents report model ids with dots (such as
    OpenCode's `claude-opus-4.7`) while the LiteLLM table keys them by the
    dashed API string (`claude-opus-4-7`), so
    [`agentsview usage daily`](/docs/token-usage/#agentsview-usage-daily) priced
    those sessions at `$0.00`. Every cost lookup now falls back to the
    dot-to-dash form.
- Speed up **sync project resolution** by avoiding unnecessary `git`
    subprocesses. Resolving a session's project now prefers a cheap filesystem
    `.git` walk for normal repos and linked worktrees instead of shelling out to
    `git` per session, keeping the previous git-based lookup as a fallback for
    rare live-repo layouts. On a ~35.7k-session archive this brings cold-sync
    time back from about 4m31s to about 1m14s.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.32.0

<small>2026-06-03</small>

**New features**

- Add support for newer **Antigravity CLI SQLite sessions** stored as
    `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/conversations/<uuid>.db`. AgentsView discovers
    the SQLite files directly, prefers them over same-ID encrypted `.pb` files,
    parses the trajectory steps through the shared Antigravity SQLite/protobuf
    path, and includes `.db-wal` / `.db-shm` metadata in change detection so
    live updates resync reliably. The existing encrypted `.pb`, `agy-reader`
    sidecar, and plaintext summary flows remain in place for older Antigravity
    CLI sessions. See [Session Discovery](/docs/configuration/#session-discovery).
- Add **Copilot CLI token usage tracking**. The parser now reads assistant
    output tokens from `assistant.message` events and model-level input, output,
    cache-read, cache-write, and reasoning totals from `session.shutdown`
    `modelMetrics`. Claude model IDs reported with dotted versions are
    normalized to the pricing-catalog form, so Copilot CLI rows now contribute
    to the [Usage dashboard](/docs/token-usage/#usage-dashboard),
    `agentsview usage`, and per-session usage reports after the 0.32.0 resync.
- Add `GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/usage`, a per-session usage REST endpoint that
    returns the same stable JSON fields as
    [`agentsview session usage --format json`](/docs/session-api/#agentsview-session-usage),
    including cost status, model lists, and unpriced models. The endpoint
    works under both local SQLite-backed `agentsview serve` and read-only
    [`agentsview pg serve`](/docs/pg-sync/#agentsview-pg-serve).
- Add an automatic PostgreSQL push daemon. Run `agentsview pg push --watch` for
    a foreground watcher that performs an initial catch-up push, coalesces file
    changes with `--debounce`, pushes at a periodic `--interval` floor, and
    reconnects after transient PostgreSQL failures. The new
    `agentsview pg service` command installs and manages that watcher as a
    per-user launchd service on macOS or `systemd --user` service on Linux. See
    [PostgreSQL Sync](/docs/pg-sync/#automatic-push-watcher).
- Ship fallback pricing for `claude-opus-4-7` at the current Opus 4.6 / 4.8 tier
    (`$5` input, `$25` output, `$6.25` cache creation, `$0.50` cache read per
    million tokens), so offline reports and fresh installs no longer leave Opus
    4.7 rows unpriced before the LiteLLM catalog is available locally.

**Improvements**

- Replace the custom daemon state-file and PID-lock code with the shared
    `go.kenn.io/kit` daemon runtime. CLI commands now use kit runtime records
    and start locks for daemon discovery, and the server exposes a shared
    `/api/ping` liveness endpoint.
- Switch git repository discovery and author lookup paths onto `go.kenn.io/kit`
    helpers, thread caller contexts through git outcome collection, and pin the
    Go toolchain consistently in source and Docker builds.
- Improve the PostgreSQL push/watch path so the watcher uses the same `[pg]`
    config, project filters, classifier wiring, and result-content blocking
    rules as one-shot `pg push` and normal `serve`.
- Replace custom frontend UI glyphs with shared lucide Svelte icons for more
    consistent controls, with focused icon export tests to guard the mappings.
- Improve forwarded-host rejection handling. When AgentsView is reached through
    SSH port forwarding, a reverse proxy, or a remote dev environment with an
    untrusted `Host`, the server now returns a descriptive `403` body and logs a
    breadcrumb; the frontend Settings load surfaces the same actionable
    `--public-url` hint instead of a generic forbidden error. See
    [Remote Access](/docs/remote-access/#forwarded-dev-environments).
- Update `agy-reader` install documentation to the current module root command:
    `go install github.com/mjacobs/agy-reader@latest`.

**Bug fixes**

- Stop benign `tar` warnings from aborting SSH remote sync. The local extractor
    now uses Go's `archive/tar`, skips only known self-referential hardlinks,
    and still fails on malformed, truncated, or path-escaping archives. Remote
    `tar` non-zero exits are tolerated only when every stderr line matches known
    "file changed/removed while reading" warnings.
- Rename the private frontend npm package from the old working name to
    `agentsview-frontend`, matching the current project identity and avoiding
    package-name conflicts.

## 0.31.1

<small>2026-05-28</small>

**Bug fixes**

- Add fallback pricing for **Claude Opus 4.8** so cost estimates stay accurate
    before the model reaches the LiteLLM catalog. Opus 4.8 launched at the same
    rates as Opus 4.6 / 4.7 ($5 input / $25 output per million tokens,
    $6.25 / $0.50 cache create / read), but with no catalog entry yet the
    exact-match cost lookup priced its messages at $0 in `agentsview usage`.
    AgentsView now seeds a `claude-opus-4-8` fallback row at the current Opus
    tier; the background LiteLLM refresh takes over automatically once the
    upstream catalog adds the model.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.31.0

<small>2026-05-28</small>

**New features**

- Parse **decrypted Antigravity CLI trajectory sidecars** for richer Antigravity
    session imports. When a `<uuid>.trajectory.json` file sits next to the
    existing AES-encrypted `<uuid>.pb` transcript (under
    `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/conversations/` or `implicit/`), AgentsView uses
    it as the source of truth for messages, tool calls, and tool results,
    falling back to the `history.jsonl` + `brain/` artifact path when no sidecar
    is present. The sidecars are produced out-of-process by
    [agy-reader](https://github.com/mjacobs/agy-reader), which performs the
    decryption and writes plain JSON — so this path needs no `ANTIGRAVITY_KEY`.
    AgentsView treats the sidecar as untrusted input: unknown step types are
    skipped and reads are size-capped. The in-process `ANTIGRAVITY_KEY` decrypt
    path is preserved as a fallback. See
    [Session Discovery](/docs/configuration/#session-discovery).
- Expand **[secret scanning](/docs/session-api/#secret-scanning)** with six more
    well-anchored vendor rules: OpenAI (`sk-proj-`, `sk-svcacct-`, `sk-admin-`),
    GitLab personal access tokens (`glpat-…`), npm tokens (`npm_…`), PyPI API
    tokens (`pypi-…` macaroons), Hugging Face tokens (`hf_…`), and SendGrid keys
    (`SG.…`). The CLI summary now splits counts into definite vs. candidate
    findings — `N findings (X definite, Y candidate)` — and points you at
    [`agentsview secrets list --confidence all`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-secrets)
    when candidate-tier matches exist. JSON consumers get the new count fields
    automatically.

**Improvements**

- Give the right-column [Session Vital Signs](/docs/usage/#session-vital-signs)
    panel a sticky **Analysis** title bar with an explicit close button, and
    make the header toggle read *Show / Hide session analysis* based on the
    panel's current state.
- Add hover and title hints plus accessible labels across the compact title bar,
    session breadcrumb, sidebar group headers, and modal controls, improving the
    experience for assistive-technology users.
- Document the project's current security posture — threat model, trust
    boundaries, outbound channels, data-at-rest sensitivity, and open questions
    — in a new
    [`SECURITY.md`](https://github.com/kenn-io/agentsview/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
- Update frontend dependencies and the Docker / CI GitHub Actions.

**Bug fixes**

- Treat only `401 Unauthorized` from a settings load as a token-auth challenge.
    A `403 Forbidden` response now surfaces as a settings error instead of
    triggering a misleading auth-token prompt.
- Use the GitHub release **redirect endpoint** in the installers and the
    in-binary updater (`install.sh`, `install.ps1`, and `agentsview update`),
    reading the `releases/latest` 302 target instead of calling
    `api.github.com`. Users behind shared NAT, VPN, or CGNAT no longer exhaust
    the unauthenticated API's 60-request hourly quota during install or update.

## 0.30.1

<small>2026-05-25</small>

**Bug fixes**

- Refresh pricing from LiteLLM when
    [`agentsview session usage`](/docs/session-api/#agentsview-session-usage)
    hits an unpriced model. The command previously reported
    `Cost: n/a (unpriced: <model>)` for a newly released model even when LiteLLM
    already had the rate — running `agentsview serve` once was enough to fix it,
    because the server's background refresh populated the catalog, while the CLI
    path only seeded the embedded fallback. The CLI now triggers a one-shot
    LiteLLM fetch when it encounters an unpriced model and no daemon is running,
    then re-queries. A one-hour cooldown keeps repeated invocations — or
    persistent fetch failures when offline — from pinging LiteLLM on every call.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.30.0

<small>2026-05-24</small>

**New features**

- Add full **session content search** across stored transcripts — substring, RE2
    regex, or FTS5 tokenized modes — over message bodies, tool inputs, and tool
    result content. Exposed as `agentsview session search <pattern>` with the
    standard session filters (`--project`, `--agent`, `--date-from`, etc.) plus
    `--regex`, `--fts`, and `--in messages,tool_input,tool_result`, and over
    HTTP at `GET /api/v1/search/content`. Snippets are returned with ~60
    characters of context on each side, snapped to rune boundaries, and any
    value that matches a secret-scanner rule is masked unless the caller passes
    `--reveal` from localhost.
- Add **secret scanning** for session content. A new `internal/secrets` rule
    pack flags definite vendor formats (AWS access keys, `sk-ant-…`, `ghp_…`,
    `github_pat_…`, `xoxb/xoxa/xoxp/xoxr/xoxs`, Stripe `sk_live_…` /
    `rk_live_…`, Google `AIza…` keys, PEM private-key blocks) plus an opt-in
    candidate tier (basic-auth URLs, JWTs, high-entropy assignments). Definite
    findings are scored inline during sync; the new
    [`agentsview secrets`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-secrets) command group
    lists them (redacted by default) and re-scans the archive for the candidate
    tier on demand. Sessions carry a `secret_leak_count` summary that surfaces
    in [`session get`](/docs/session-api/#agentsview-session-get) and a new
    [`session list --has-secret`](/docs/session-api/#agentsview-session-list)
    filter; the same shape is mirrored in PostgreSQL sync.
- Add
    [`agentsview session usage <id>`](/docs/session-api/#agentsview-session-usage),
    a per-session token-and-cost report. Prints output and peak-context totals
    plus a `~$X.XX` model-pricing estimate, with `--format json` for scripting.
    Reuses the same LiteLLM pricing table and `custom_model_pricing` overrides
    as `agentsview usage daily`, and runs an on-demand sync for the target
    session when no daemon is running. Replaces the older `token-use`
    subcommand, which remains as a deprecated alias.
- Add support for **Google Antigravity** IDE and CLI sessions
    ([Antigravity](https://antigravity.google), Google's agentic IDE). The IDE
    parser opens per-session SQLite databases under
    `~/.gemini/antigravity/conversations/` and decodes the protobuf step
    payloads; the CLI parser reads `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/` and surfaces the
    plaintext `brain/` artifacts and `history.jsonl`. Setting `ANTIGRAVITY_KEY`
    to the base64-encoded AES key additionally decrypts the `.pb` transcripts,
    mirroring the strategy used by the upstream
    [`antigravity_decryptor`](https://github.com/arashz/antigravity_decryptor)
    Python tool. Override the directories with `ANTIGRAVITY_DIR` /
    `antigravity_dirs` and `ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_DIR` / `antigravity_cli_dirs`.
- Add support for **[Qwen Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code)**
    (`~/.qwen/projects/`, override with `QWEN_PROJECTS_DIR` or
    `qwen_project_dirs`), **QClaw** (`~/.qclaw/assets/static/agents/`, override
    with `QCLAW_DIR` or `qclaw_dirs`), and **WorkBuddy**
    (`~/.workbuddy/projects/`, override with `WORKBUDDY_PROJECTS_DIR` or
    `workbuddy_project_dirs`). WorkBuddy includes inline subagent linking via
    `<sessionId>:subagent:<subagentId>` IDs.
- Add support for the **current Kiro CLI SQLite store** at
    `~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3`. The Kiro CLI parser now reads both
    the legacy `~/.kiro/sessions/cli/` JSONL layout and the SQLite
    `conversations_v2` table; when the same conversation exists in both, the
    SQLite record wins.
- Add **PostgreSQL curation metadata** to `pg push`. Starred sessions and pinned
    messages now sync to two new tables (`starred_sessions`, `pinned_messages`)
    so curation state is shared across machines through the same push. Pinned
    messages are reconciled by `source_uuid`, so pins survive message-ordinal
    shifts after a re-parse.
- Add
    [configurable insight agent binaries](/docs/recall/#configuring-agent-binaries).
    Set `[agent.<name>] binary = "..."` in `~/.agentsview/config.toml` to
    point each insight-generation agent (Claude, Codex, Copilot, Gemini, Kiro)
    at a specific executable. When unset, AgentsView falls through to the
    default `PATH` lookup.

**Improvements**

- Add a [follow latest message toggle](/docs/usage/#follow-latest-message) to
    the session header. While active, the message list auto-scrolls to the
    newest message as updates stream in; clicking a specific message or
    scrolling up cancels the follow. The preference is persisted in
    localStorage.
- Honor the
    [Normal and Focused transcript modes](/docs/usage/#focused-transcript-mode)
    in the standalone HTML export. The exported file now ships with a Normal /
    Focused radio toggle in the document header, so a recipient who only wants
    the user-and-final view can flip into Focused mode without re-running the
    export.
- Add **copy buttons to code blocks** in session messages, matching the
    per-message copy action. The button appears on hover/focus over the code
    block and copies the raw code (no fences).
- Import richer **Hermes** state-database metadata — parent-continuation chains,
    titles, per-message token usage, and inline cost — and classify Hermes
    compaction handoffs as compact-boundary system messages. Hermes now
    contributes to `agentsview usage` totals.
- Normalize **Gemini** per-message token usage into the same `input_tokens` /
    `output_tokens` / `cache_creation_input_tokens` / `cache_read_input_tokens`
    shape used by Claude and Codex, with Gemini thoughts counted toward output
    tokens and cached prefix toward cache reads. Gemini sessions now produce
    real cost rows in `agentsview usage` instead of showing up only in the
    models-used list.
- Note Homebrew Cask in the README install section:
    `brew install --cask agentsview` is the recommended desktop-app install on
    macOS.
- Rename the upstream repository to
    [`github.com/kenn-io/agentsview`](https://github.com/kenn-io/agentsview),
    publish the container image at `ghcr.io/kenn-io/agentsview`, and adopt the
    `go.kenn.io/agentsview` vanity Go module path. All references in the docs
    site have been updated to match.

**Bug fixes**

- Load the sidebar from a new skinny session-index endpoint so large refreshes
    no longer trip a render storm against the full session payload — the index
    returns lightweight rows and the visible rows hydrate on demand.
- Widen the server's CSP `connect-src` to allow `http:`, `https:`, `ws:`, and
    `wss:` origins so the desktop app's **Connect to Remote Server** action can
    reach external AgentsView instances. Other CSP directives stay pinned to
    `'self'`.
- Skip slash-command first messages (`/login`, `/plan`, `/clear`, …) when
    computing the sidebar preview text, instead of the previous allowlist that
    only covered `/clear` and `/effort`. The slash-prefix heuristic matches any
    `/<word>` followed by end-of-string or whitespace, so absolute file paths in
    user messages still surface normally.
- Fix a Windows desktop sidecar lock during in-place updates — the bundled Go
    server is now stopped only immediately before the Tauri updater swaps the
    binary, so the download phase no longer races against the running
    `agentsview.exe`.
- Harden temporary-directory cleanup in tests against open SQLite handles on
    Windows by forcing a GC and retrying `RemoveAll` with exponential backoff.
    CI-only change.

## 0.29.0

<small>2026-05-10</small>

**New features**

- Add session support for [Piebald](https://piebald.ai), a database-backed
    coding agent. AgentsView discovers Piebald's `app.db` SQLite file under
    `~/.local/share/piebald/` (override with `PIEBALD_DIR` or `piebald_dirs`),
    opens it read-only, and parses each chat on demand into the standard
    user/assistant/tool model. Reasoning parts are surfaced as
    `[Thinking]…[/Thinking]` blocks, tool calls are mapped onto AgentsView's
    taxonomy, and Piebald's `sub_agent_chat_id` links parent tool calls to the
    spawned child chat so subagent expansion works inline. Per-chat incremental
    sync only re-parses rows whose `updated_at` changed.
- Add user-configurable
    [worktree project mappings](/docs/configuration/#worktree-project-mappings).
    AgentsView normally infers a session's project from its `cwd`, which doesn't
    recognize custom worktree layouts like
    `~/code/{project}.worktrees/feat/<branch>/` — those sessions end up grouped
    under the branch name instead of the parent repo. The new **Worktree Project
    Mappings** section in Settings lets you register a path-prefix → project
    mapping per machine, applied to new sessions as they sync and, via an
    **Apply** button, retroactively to already-imported sessions. Mappings live
    in a `worktree_project_mappings` SQLite table scoped to the host machine, so
    mappings created on one machine never leak into another's view of synced
    sessions.

**Improvements**

- Add Piebald to the
    [supported-agents reference table](/docs/configuration/#session-discovery)
    in the README and to the docs.
- Fix sync progress accounting for database-backed agents (Piebald, OpenCode,
    Warp, Forge): the terminal `PhaseDone` callback was overwriting the
    cumulative `MessagesIndexed` count with the file-only total, so the
    post-sync log line under-reported indexed messages.
- Validate Piebald fork session IDs (`piebald:<chat>-<row>`). Stale or typoed
    fork IDs that resolved to a real base chat but not a real fork row
    previously returned mtimes and succeeded silently; they now require an exact
    `Session.ID` match in the parsed results.
- Drop the hard-coded agent list from `agentsview --help`. The list went stale
    every time a new agent was added; the README's supported-agents table and
    the per-agent env vars below it stay authoritative.
- Update GitHub Actions, Go, and frontend dependencies.

**Bug fixes**

- Discover and import Codex sessions from `~/.codex/archived_sessions/` in
    addition to `~/.codex/sessions/`, supporting both the dated live-session
    layout and the flat archived layout. Sessions are deduplicated by canonical
    session ID, with live paths preferred when a session exists in both
    locations.
- Link Claude `Task` and `Agent` tool calls to their child subagent sessions
    when result-side `toolUseResult.agentId` is the only signal available
    (queue/progress mapping absent). The parser also preserves sibling subagent
    tool calls when Claude emits additive same-`message.id` assistant chunks, so
    parallel subagents under one parent message all link inline. Existing Claude
    archives need a full resync to pick up the populated `subagent_session_id`
    on historical rows.

    mappings.

## 0.28.0

<small>2026-05-06</small>

**New features**

- Add session support for [Forge](https://forgecode.dev), a database-backed
    coding agent. AgentsView discovers `.forge.db` SQLite files under `~/.forge`
    (override with `FORGE_DIR` or `forge_dirs`), opens them read-only, and
    parses each conversation on demand into the standard user/assistant/tool
    model. Reasoning traces are surfaced as `[Thinking]…[/Thinking]` blocks, and
    Forge's nine agent-specific tool names (`fs_search`, `patch`, `multi_patch`,
    `undo`, `remove`, `fetch`, `todo_write`, `todo_read`, `parallel`) are mapped
    onto AgentsView's taxonomy. Per-conversation incremental sync only re-parses
    rows whose `updated_at` changed.

**Improvements**

- Preview common tool inputs in the collapsed
    [tool block](/docs/usage/#tool-blocks) header so the most meaningful field
    shows without expanding. `TodoWrite` surfaces the in-progress todo (or last
    todo) with a `→` prefix; `TaskCreate` shows the subject; `TaskUpdate` shows
    `#<id> · <status> · <subject>`; `Skill` shows the skill name; `ToolSearch`
    shows the first line of the query; and `Task`/`Agent`/subagent calls show
    the description (falling back to the prompt). These previews take precedence
    over the first line of `content`, which for these tools is a generic header
    that hides the useful information.
- Link Codex `spawn_agent` tool calls to the spawned subagent's session, so the
    inline subagent expander in the message viewer works the same way for Codex
    sessions as it already did for Claude `Task` calls.
- Make git outcome metrics opt-in for [`agentsview stats`](/docs/stats/).
    Outcome aggregation walks every session's working directory and shells out
    to `git`, which is slow on large repos and brittle when the cwd has moved or
    the repo is unavailable. Add `--include-git-outcomes` to opt into local
    commit, LOC, and files-changed totals, and `--include-github-outcomes` to
    additionally include GitHub PR counts via `gh` (this implies
    `--include-git-outcomes`). The `GHToken` is only resolved when GitHub
    outcomes are requested.

**Bug fixes**

- Link Codex App subagent spawn events to the corresponding child session. The
    Codex parser now consumes both `spawn_agent` outputs and
    `collab_agent_spawn_end.new_thread_id` events, recognizes `wait_agent` calls
    with `targets`, and accepts subagent notifications that identify children
    via `agent_path` alongside the legacy `agent_id`. Without this, related
    Codex App subagent sessions did not resolve in the transcript or in the
    sidebar's child list.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Matthew Jacobs](https://github.com/mjacobs) for adding Forge agent
    support.
- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for linking
    Codex spawn calls to subagent sessions and linking Codex app subagents.

    tool calls.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.27.0

<small>2026-05-04</small>

**New features**

- Publish official Docker images. The
    [`ghcr.io/kenn-io/agentsview`](https://github.com/kenn-io/agentsview/pkgs/container/agentsview)
    multi-arch image (linux/amd64, linux/arm64) is built on tagged releases
    and pushes to main, and the repo ships a `Dockerfile`,
    `docker-entrypoint.sh`, and a `docker-compose.prod.yaml` example. The same
    image runs both `agentsview serve` (default) and `agentsview pg serve` (set
    `PG_SERVE=1`). See the [Quick Start](/docs/quickstart/#docker) for usage.
- Add a [session status indicator](/docs/usage/#session-status-indicator) that
    classifies each session by recency and termination state and surfaces six
    visual states (working, waiting, idle, stale, unclean, quiet) on the sidebar
    dot and the dashboard's Top Sessions table. Backed by a new
    `termination_status` column on the `sessions` table populated by the Claude
    Code and Codex parsers from per-message stop reasons. Sessions can now be
    filtered by status from the [filter dropdown](/docs/usage/#session-filters)
    or via the new `?termination=` URL parameter.
- Use Copilot CLI's `workspace.yaml` `name` field as the session title when
    present, falling back to the first user message otherwise. Copilot itself
    writes a short generated or user-set name to that file, so sessions now show
    meaningful titles like *"Fix login authentication bug"* instead of the
    verbatim first prompt. Existing AgentsView display-name overrides still win.

**Improvements**

- Degrade large watch trees instead of failing server startup. When the
    recursive file watcher hits its 8192-directory budget or the OS
    inotify/file-descriptor limit (`EMFILE`/`ENOSPC`), the affected root falls
    back to the existing 15-minute periodic sync plus a new 2-minute poll loop,
    and the server logs which roots are watched vs. polled. The HTTP listener
    now binds before the watcher is registered, so users hitting these limits no
    longer see startup abort with `socket: too many open files`.
- Sessions, Usage, and the Analytics dashboard now share a single filter store:
    machine, agent, project, min user-message, and one-shot/automated toggles
    applied in the sidebar carry across to the Usage page header and the
    dashboard panels. The Usage page reuses the same `SessionFilterControl`
    widget with searchable agent and machine multi-selects (the sidebar's
    **Status** pills are sidebar- and dashboard-only).
- Fix the README `agentsview stats` reference (the README previously showed the
    non-existent `agentsview session stats` form).

**Bug fixes**

- Return `409 Conflict` when uploading a session that is already excluded by
    config or sitting in the trash, instead of silently dropping the upload.
- Allow compaction-boundary summary cards to expand in the message viewer. Long
    or multi-line summaries get a "Show full summary" toggle; short summaries
    stay inline.
- Read the `model` and `usage` fields from OpenClaw assistant turns so
    `agentsview usage daily --agent openclaw` reports actual cost and token
    totals instead of `$0.00`.
- Synthesize `Message.ID` from the message ordinal in
    [`pg serve`](/docs/pg-sync/) responses. PG's `messages` table has a
    composite primary key (`session_id`, `ordinal`) and no `id` column, which
    previously left every row with `id = 0` and broke Svelte's keyed `{#each}`
    rendering in the message viewer.

## 0.26.1

<small>2026-04-30</small>

**Improvements**

- Refresh the filter controls and active-filter displays on the Sessions, Usage,
    and Analytics views for clearer state and more consistent behavior across
    the three pages.
- Add launchd support for running the PostgreSQL helper service on macOS.
- Update frontend and Go dependencies.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix session filter behavior in the sidebar.
- Fix Usage page filter behavior and the selected-filter state.
- Keep timing API response arrays non-null.
- Disable the WebKit DMABUF renderer on Linux desktop builds to avoid rendering
    issues.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.26.0

<small>2026-04-29</small>

**New features**

- Add a [Trends page](/docs/usage/#trends) for ad-hoc term-frequency line charts
    over your session history. Plot up to 12 terms — each with optional
    pipe-separated variants like `cat|cats` — at day, week, or month
    granularity, and optionally normalize counts by message volume. Backed by
    both SQLite and PostgreSQL, so the page works under local `agentsview serve`
    and shared [`pg serve`](/docs/pg-sync/) deployments.
- Replace the right-column activity minimap with a richer
    [Session Vital Signs](/docs/usage/#session-vital-signs) panel covering total
    wall-clock, slowest call, per-category time spent, a per-category timeline,
    and a chronological calls list with parallel groups bracketed and sub-agents
    expandable inline. Each tool block in the conversation now also shows a
    duration badge, and each assistant message shows a per-turn summary line.
- Make the default date range on the Usage and Analytics dashboards *rolling* —
    pages left open across midnight roll the window forward at the next refresh
    tick, sync event, or manual refresh, instead of staying anchored to the day
    they loaded. Manual date edits or `?from=…&to=…` URL parameters pin the
    window; preset buttons (`7d`, `30d`, `90d`, `1y`) return to rolling mode.

**Improvements**

- Scale call duration bars in the Vital Signs Calls list relative to the longest
    call in scope rather than total session wall-clock, so call-vs-call
    comparison stays legible in long sessions.
- Lower the progressive-load threshold from 20,000 to 3,000 messages so large
    sessions render the message viewer faster — older pages lazy-load on scroll
    instead of all loading on session open.
- Reuse the shared `DateRangeSelector` component on the Usage page for
    consistent presets and behavior between Analytics and Usage.
- Faster full resync: batched SQLite writes with per-session savepoints,
    multi-row inserts for messages and tool calls, and a single FTS rebuild on
    the temp database before the atomic swap. On a 26.7k-session workload,
    full-resync wall-clock improved from about 1m17s to about 34s.
- Expand [Gemini ingestion](/docs/configuration/#session-discovery) to discover
    and parse the newer streamed `session-*.jsonl` format alongside the legacy
    `.json` Gemini session files.
- Render Claude Code `!cmd` bash shortcut wrappers (`<bash-input>`,
    `<bash-stdout>`, `<bash-stderr>`) as code blocks in message bodies and as
    inline `<code>` in sidebar previews and breadcrumbs, instead of leaking the
    literal pseudo-HTML into the UI.

**Bug fixes**

- Recognize managed worktree project paths — Middleman GitHub worktrees and
    Codex App's `~/.codex/worktrees/<id>/<repo>` layout — as the owning repo, so
    sessions land under the right project instead of the worktree id.
- Sync OpenCode SQLite sessions when `opencode.db` and the per-file `storage/`
    layout coexist in the same root. SQLite virtual paths are used as a fallback
    for source lookup and single-session sync in those hybrid roots.
- Surface Claude Code `queued_command` attachments — the user prompts submitted
    while a tool call is still running — as regular user messages in the
    transcript instead of dropping them. The embedded `dataVersion` bumps from
    19 to 20 so existing databases re-parse on next startup and recover any
    previously missed mid-flight messages.
- Run remote [SSH sync](/docs/commands/#agentsview-sync) commands through
    `sh -c` so command parsing is independent of the remote login shell and
    embedded single quotes are escaped safely.
- Atomically swap the binary during self-update by staging the new binary at
    `dstPath + ".new"` (with the executable bit already set) and renaming it
    into place, so concurrent `agentsview` invocations during an update no
    longer hit a partially written or non-executable file.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.25.0

<small>2026-04-25</small>

**Improvements**

- Use `is_automated` consistently across [`agentsview stats`](/docs/stats/)
    totals, archetypes, distributions, and agent portfolio metrics, so the stats
    report uses the stored automation classification instead of mixing in older
    user-message-count heuristics.
- Rename the data directory environment variable to `AGENTSVIEW_DATA_DIR`. The
    legacy `AGENT_VIEWER_DATA_DIR` name is still accepted as a fallback when the
    canonical variable is unset.
- Build and test against Go 1.26. Source builds now require Go 1.26+ with CGO.

**Bug fixes**

- Filter synthetic Copilot skill messages from parsed conversations, so injected
    skill context no longer affects stored transcripts, first messages, or
    user-message counts.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for NilAway
    lint checks and updating the build to Go 1.26 and fixing an arm64 desktop
    test flake.

    Copilot skill messages.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.24.0

<small>2026-04-23</small>

**New features**

- Add OpenCode storage-backed session support. AgentsView now auto-detects when
    an OpenCode root uses the per-file `storage/` layout (`storage/session`,
    `storage/message`, `storage/part`) and parses the JSON files directly. The
    legacy `opencode.db` SQLite backend is still read transparently when that's
    what's present — see
    [Session Discovery](/docs/configuration/#session-discovery).
- Add [custom model pricing](/docs/token-usage/#custom-model-pricing) via
    `[custom_model_pricing.<model>]` tables in `~/.agentsview/config.toml`, for
    models not in the LiteLLM catalog or when you want to override the catalog's
    rates.
- Add configurable
    [automation patterns](/docs/configuration/#automated-session-detection) via
    `[automated] prefixes`, `substrings`, and `exact_matches` in
    `~/.agentsview/config.toml`, so single-turn sessions with first-message
    patterns unique to your own automation get filtered from session lists and
    analytics alongside the built-in roborev patterns.

**Improvements**

- Broaden built-in automated-session detection to cover Claude Code
    conversation-title generation, warmup pings, roborev review combiner
    prompts, and AgentsView's own changelog generator.
- Refresh the `is_automated` classification at startup, using a classifier hash
    that covers built-in patterns and configured `[automated]` patterns, so
    edits to automation rules and rows imported from other archives get
    re-labeled without a manual resync.
- Improve Claude first-message selection in the sidebar by skipping leading
    `/clear` and `/effort` command envelopes so the session preview shows the
    next real user message instead.

**Bug fixes**

- Narrow OpenCode's storage-mode file-watch root to the `storage/` subtree,
    reducing inotify pressure and spurious watch events on binaries, logs, and
    caches. SQLite mode continues to watch the `opencode.db` parent.
- Stop orphaned subagent/fork rows from surfacing as top-level groups in the
    sidebar when their parent session has been filtered or rotated off disk.
- Fix Codex parser handling so `codex exec` sessions interrupted mid-run (which
    emit a synthetic `<turn_aborted>` user message) are classified and counted
    correctly.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Eran Sandler](https://github.com/erans) for adding OpenCode
    storage-backed session support.
- Thanks to [Antoine](https://github.com/anth2o) for custom model pricing via
    config.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.23.5

<small>2026-04-20</small>

**Improvements**

- Coalesce rapid dashboard update events to cap refetch frequency and keep the
    UI smoother under heavy activity.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.23.1

<small>2026-04-19</small>

**Bug fixes**

- Usage reporting excludes cached Codex tokens from `input_tokens`, making token
    totals more accurate.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.23.0

<small>2026-04-19</small>

**New features**

- Add live dashboard refresh via Server-Sent Events so the Sessions and Usage
    views update without a full page reload when new sync data lands.
- Add [session intelligence](/docs/session-intelligence/) with health signals,
    outcome classification, score/grade badges, a per-session signal panel, and
    aggregated dashboard health analytics.
- Add the [`agentsview session`](/docs/session-api/) CLI as a programmatic
    surface for listing, inspecting, exporting, syncing, and watching session
    data.
- Add markdown export for sessions via `/api/v1/sessions/{id}/md`, including
    optional child-session depth controls.
- Add SSH remote sync to [`agentsview sync`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-sync) so
    a local archive can pull session data from a remote machine over SSH.
- Add PostgreSQL-backed usage reporting so the Usage dashboard and related
    endpoints work under [`agentsview pg serve`](/docs/pg-sync/).
- Add [`agentsview stats`](/docs/stats/), an experimental window-scoped reporter
    for session, git, and outcome activity across the local archive.

**Improvements**

- Require the explicit `serve` subcommand to start the server; plain
    `agentsview` now shows help.
- Show session names in the Usage page's Top Sessions by Cost table.
- Preserve active filters when switching between the Sessions and Usage tabs.
- Link the Usage page's `Project | Model | Agent` group-by selectors so the
    chart and attribution panel stay in sync.
- Make incremental parsing more reliable by validating files with inode and
    device tracking in addition to size and mtime.
- Rewrite the project README as a clearer user-facing guide.

**Bug fixes**

- Surface the underlying login-shell probe failure reason for arm64 desktop
    flake cases instead of hiding the root cause.
- Only self-heal the frontend events store on transient failures, avoiding
    permanent retry loops against unsupported event streams.
- Accept raw session IDs in `agentsview token-use` in addition to canonical
    stored IDs.
- Resolve ephemeral `serve` port handling correctly.
- Parse Claude Code CLI JSON array output correctly in insight generation.
- Recognize the `"helpful assistant"` prefix as an automated session.
- Skip git-root walking for foreign-OS working directories.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for linking
    usage group-by selectors, migrating command tree to Cobra, adding markdown
    session export, resolving ephemeral serve port, showing session name in Top
    Sessions by Cost, and preserving filters when switching between the Sessions
    and Usage tabs.

    validate incremental parses.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.22.2

<small>2026-04-13</small>

**Bug fixes**

- Correct fallback pricing for Claude Opus 4.6 so usage cost estimates use the
    proper `$5` input and `$25` output rates.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.22.1

<small>2026-04-13</small>

**Bug fixes**

- Keep Codex model detection consistent during incremental syncs so usage
    reporting stays accurate.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.22.0

<small>2026-04-13</small>

**Improvements**

- Extend usage cost tracking to
    [OpenCode and Pi](/docs/token-usage/#agent-coverage) sessions alongside
    Claude Code and Codex. Their token counts now flow into the
    [Usage dashboard](/docs/token-usage/#usage-dashboard) and `agentsview usage`
    CLI reports.
- Refine the Usage dashboard summary cards and cost-over-time chart for clearer
    cost reporting.

**Bug fixes**

- Sync Codex `exec` sessions so execution activity appears reliably in
    AgentsView.
- Fix usage accounting so total cost data stays complete across supported
    providers.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.21.0

<small>2026-04-13</small>

**New features**

- Add a [token usage dashboard](/docs/token-usage/#usage-dashboard) to the web
    UI for exploring cost and token totals across your agent sessions. The new
    `/usage` page shows summary cards, a cost-over-time chart, a cost
    attribution treemap with project/model/agent toggles, top sessions by cost,
    and a cache efficiency panel. Filter by project, agent, model, and date
    range — filter state is written back to the URL so views are shareable and
    bookmarkable.
- Add backing API endpoints for the usage dashboard so scripts and external
    tools can fetch the same summary, time series, and attribution data the UI
    uses.

**Bug fixes**

- Prevent some Claude usage records from being double-counted in cost and token
    totals.
- Correct Opus 4.6 pricing in usage cost calculations.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.20.0

<small>2026-04-12</small>

**New features**

- Add [`agentsview usage daily`](/docs/token-usage/#agentsview-usage-daily) and
    [`agentsview usage statusline`](/docs/token-usage/#agentsview-usage-statusline)
    commands that report token usage and estimated cost by day or for the
    current day, scoped to Claude Code and Codex sessions. Pricing is pulled
    from the LiteLLM catalog with an embedded fallback for offline use. See
    [Token Usage & Costs](/docs/token-usage/) for the full reporting model and
    coverage details.
- Add [OpenHands CLI](/docs/configuration/#session-discovery) session support.
    Local OpenHands conversations under `~/.openhands/conversations` are
    discovered, synced, and rendered alongside other agents. A new shallow-watch
    mode is used for agents that store each conversation in its own
    subdirectory, so file watchers don't exhaust inotify limits.
- Add [Positron Assistant](/docs/configuration/#session-discovery) session
    support. Positron is a VS Code–based IDE; chat sessions under
    `workspaceStorage/*/chatSessions/` are parsed using the VSCode Copilot
    format. Built-in discovery covers macOS only in 0.20.0 — Linux and Windows
    users need to set `POSITRON_DIR` or `positron_dirs`.
- Filter pinned messages by the currently selected project. The
    [Pinned](/docs/usage/#pinned-messages) page only shows pins from the active
    project, the count badge reflects the filtered total, and a dedicated empty
    state is shown when the filter yields no results.

**Improvements**

- Drop the Intel macOS desktop builds regression. Release artifacts now include
    `.dmg` files for both Apple Silicon (`aarch64`) and Intel (`x86_64`) Macs, a
    Linux `arm64` AppImage for PR artifact coverage, plus the existing Linux
    `x86_64` AppImage and Windows `.exe`.
- Stop enumerating agent names in CLI help text so the `--agent` flag and
    one-line descriptions don't go stale every time a new agent lands.

**Bug fixes**

- Auto-recover the macOS desktop app when WKWebView's content process is killed
    during sleep/wake. A Rust-side focus probe detects a dead WebView and
    force-reloads it; a JavaScript `visibilitychange` handler pings the backend
    and reloads if unreachable.
- Honor `pi_dirs`, `cursor_project_dirs`, and `amp_dirs` from `config.toml`.
    These arrays were previously dropped by the loader because the registry
    entries for Pi, Cursor, and Amp were missing `ConfigKey`.
- Claude Code streaming messages were being recorded multiple times by the
    parser, inflating historical input-token totals by roughly 2×. The parser
    now deduplicates them. After upgrading, the first `agentsview usage`
    invocation triggers a full resync so historical totals are recomputed with
    the fix.
- Codex sessions now capture the per-request `token_count` events embedded in
    `event_msg` entries, so Codex messages populate token usage (and therefore
    show up in [`agentsview usage daily`](/docs/token-usage/)) where they
    previously reported zero.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.19.0

<small>2026-04-08</small>

**New features**

- Add Warp agent session support, reading AI conversations from Warp's local
    SQLite database with tool call breakdowns and token usage.
- Add Hermes Agent session support across CLI, Discord, webhook, and cron
    platforms, with per-platform project grouping and skill prefix handling.
- Add Cortex Code session support for Snowflake's AI coding agent, parsing both
    embedded-history and split-file formats.
- Add Kiro CLI and Kiro IDE session support for Amazon's AI coding assistant,
    including unified diff rendering for edit actions.
- Add Cursor session history with resume (`cursor agent --resume`) and automatic
    workspace recovery via `--workspace`.
- Add the ability to resume Claude sessions in Claude Desktop via the session
    resume menu (macOS).

**Improvements**

- Add [project filtering](/docs/pg-sync/#project-filtering) to `pg push` with
    `--projects`, `--exclude-projects`, and `--all-projects` flags plus config
    file equivalents. A new
    [`agentsview projects`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-projects) command lists
    all projects with session counts.
- Add an opt-out for the update check via `disable_update_check` in config,
    `AGENTSVIEW_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK=1` environment variable, or
    `--no-update-check` CLI flag.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix the synced status label staying stale after a sync completes. The relative
    time now refreshes every 10 seconds, and hovering shows the exact sync
    timestamp.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Jacob Struzik](https://github.com/jstruzik) for resuming Claude

    support.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.18.0

<small>2026-04-02</small>

**New features**

- Import [Claude.ai and ChatGPT conversations](/docs/chat-import/) into
    AgentsView. Upload the zip file export from either service via the UI or CLI
    to bring your full conversation history — including ChatGPT images — into
    your local database alongside your agent coding sessions.
- Show token usage metrics across sessions, analytics views, and exports.
    Session breadcrumbs display peak context and output tokens, the analytics
    dashboard includes output token summary cards and heatmap metrics, and CSV
    exports include token totals.

**Improvements**

- Detect automated roborev sessions and filter them out of session lists,
    counts, and analytics by default. An "Include automated" toggle in the
    session filter dropdown opts back in.

**Bug fixes**

- Keep pinned messages pinned after a session resync. Previously, re-syncing a
    session's messages could silently remove all pins due to cascade deletes;
    pins are now preserved by matching on message ordinal.
- Reduce WebView memory usage when rendering message content by rekeying
    content-parser caches on message ID instead of full message text and
    lowering cache capacity.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Trent Nelson](https://github.com/tpn) for token-usage metrics
    across sessions, analytics, and exports.
- Thanks to [Michael Chapman](https://github.com/MCBoarder289) for preserving

    jumping to activity hotspots within a session.
- Add a resizable session sidebar so you can drag the divider to adjust the
    layout to fit your workflow.
- Capture and display Codex subagent result events in session transcripts, with
    an expandable history of status updates per tool call.

**Improvements**

- Support Cursor's nested transcript directory layout for more reliable
    transcript discovery.

    URL-based session linking.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.16.0

<small>2026-03-24</small>

**New features**

- Add direct URL links for opening specific sessions, enabling bookmarks and
    sharing of session deep links.
- Add machine labels and multi-host filtering to separate sessions by source
    machine in shared deployments.
- Add focused transcript mode with a responsive header that strips intermediate
    tool calls and thinking blocks for easier reading.
- Add `Del` as a keyboard shortcut to delete or archive the selected session.
- Add Kimi (Moonshot AI) session support for importing and viewing Kimi
    conversations.
- Add PostgreSQL push sync and a read-only server mode (`pg push`, `pg serve`)
    for shared multi-user deployments backed by a central PostgreSQL database.

**Improvements**

- Group command palette search results by session, add a relevance/recency sort
    toggle, and match against session names in addition to message content.
- Show model information in the session UI, including Codex session models,
    displayed in message headers.
- Use OpenCode session titles as display names in the session list.
- Improve the mobile layout for smaller screens with a responsive sidebar and
    viewport-aware keyboard shortcuts.
- Add managed Caddy support to `pg serve` for simpler TLS-terminated shared
    deployments.
- Publish platform-specific wheels to PyPI for easier installation via
    `pip install agentsview`.
- Add standard macOS app menu actions for Hide and Hide Others.

**Bug fixes**

- Show user messages that begin with skill or command invocations (e.g.
    `[Skill: name]`) in transcripts instead of hiding them.
- Prevent Linux desktop app freezes with improved runtime CSP handling in the
    Tauri configuration.
- Restore desktop copy, paste, and cut keyboard shortcuts through the Edit menu.
- Fix pinned message navigation in very large sessions where the virtualizer
    could stop mid-scroll before reaching the target message.
- Surface insight generation errors directly in the UI with error status and
    message display instead of silently failing.

**New features**

- Add `agentsview token-use`, a CLI command that outputs machine-readable token
    usage data for scripts and automation.

**Improvements**

- Improve cross-platform token usage reporting on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- Make token usage insights more consistent across application and system
    restarts.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix cases where token usage can be attributed to the wrong process after PID
    reuse or restarts.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.14.0

    spread across individual modals and config file edits.
- Add remote access with bearer token authentication, trusted public origins,
    and managed Caddy reverse proxy mode for secure multi-device access.
- Organize sub-agents and teams in a collapsible tree view in the sidebar,
    making complex multi-agent sessions easier to navigate.
- Update live sessions incrementally as new activity arrives, replacing full
    refreshes for faster real-time updates.
- Add desktop zoom controls for adjusting the interface scale.

**Improvements**

- Skip common dependency and build folders (e.g. `node_modules`, `__pycache__`,
    `.git`) during recursive watching to reduce noise and overhead.
- Show release information in a new About dialog accessible from the header.
- Shut down cleanly on `Ctrl+C` and stop auto-opening the browser on startup by
    default.

    terminal in its working directory, and open the directory in
    Finder/Explorer.
- Ship packaged desktop releases (`.dmg` for macOS, `.exe` for Windows) as the
    recommended install path, with built-in auto-update support.

**Improvements**

- Replace the single-select agent filter with a multi-select agent filter,
    allowing multiple agents to be selected at once.
- Improve cross-platform path handling for more reliable session discovery on
    Windows and WSL.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix Amp tool output rendering so tool results display correctly in expanded
    tool blocks.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Michael Chapman](https://github.com/MCBoarder289) for surfacing
    Copilot reasoningText as thinking blocks.

## 0.11.0

<small>2026-03-08</small>

**New features**

- Add Pi agent support for importing and viewing Pi conversations, including
    JSONL session parsing, thinking blocks, and tool calls.

- Add session renaming (double-click or right-click context menu), soft delete
    with trash and undo, and pinned messages with a gallery view.
- Persist starred sessions in SQLite so stars survive server restarts. Existing
    localStorage stars are automatically migrated on first load.

**Improvements**

- Exclude single-turn sessions (one or fewer user messages) by default in
    session lists and analytics views to reduce noise. A new "Include
    single-turn" toggle in the sidebar filter dropdown opts back in.
- Normalize tool metadata across agents so tool calls from Gemini, Pi, and other
    agents display with the same metadata tags as their Claude equivalents.

**Bug fixes**

- Align timestamps between message headers and grouped tool call headers so they
    sit at the same right edge in all layouts.
- Show Copilot `reasoningText` as thinking blocks instead of discarding it.

title: Session API
description: Programmatic access to session data via the agentsview session CLI and REST endpoints
---

The `agentsview session` command group is a stable, programmatic surface for
reading and writing session data. It is designed for shell scripts, automation
agents, and CI jobs that need structured output rather than the web UI.

Local session reads use the AgentsView daemon over HTTP and start it when
needed. This keeps reads and writes under the same archive owner. Explicit
`--server` and `--pg` options select another backend; raw `session export`
always runs locally.

## Quick examples

```bash
# Search parsed message/tool content without scanning raw JSONL files.
agentsview session search "database timeout" --json --limit 10

# Recover recent context for one project, then fetch the first page
# of messages from a selected session.
agentsview session list --project myapp --limit 5 --json
agentsview session messages <session-id> --from 0 --limit 20 --json

# Query an already-running daemon explicitly.
agentsview session list --server http://127.0.0.1:8080 --json

# Read from configured PostgreSQL instead of local SQLite.
agentsview session search "regression" --pg --json
```

## Stability

- **Additive-only.** New fields may appear at any time. Existing fields are
  never renamed or removed.
- **Types are stable.** A field that is a string stays a string.
- **Unknown fields are safe to ignore.** Well-behaved consumers tolerate
  forward-compatible additions.

HTTP and CLI share response schemas. The CLI adds browser links when it knows
the server address. The CLI `watch` command emits NDJSON whose lines mirror
the underlying SSE events.

## Transport

Detection uses kit daemon runtime records in `AGENTSVIEW_DATA_DIR` and the
daemon ping endpoint. Runtime records include service and API metadata so
incompatible or read-only daemons are not mistaken for a writable local archive
owner.

- If `--server <url>` is set, supported commands proxy to that daemon over HTTP.
  `--server` and `--pg` are mutually exclusive. The local config `auth_token`
  is not sent to explicit URLs; set `AGENTSVIEW_SERVER_TOKEN` or pass
  `--server-token-file <path>` when that remote daemon requires auth.
- If no explicit server is set and a local daemon is running, read and write
  commands proxy to it over HTTP.
- If a [`pg serve`](/docs/pg-sync/#agentsview-pg-serve) daemon is running
  (read-only), read commands proxy to it but `session sync` refuses with a
  clear error.
- If both a writable local daemon and a `pg serve` daemon advertise the same
  data directory, the writable one wins so sync/write operations don't
  silently land on a read-only target.
- If no daemon is running, ordinary local session reads and writes start
  `agentsview serve --background`, wait for readiness, and proxy the
  operation to that daemon.
- If `AGENTSVIEW_NO_DAEMON=1` is set, the CLI never auto-starts a daemon. Read
  commands require an existing compatible daemon. The
  [`session usage`](#agentsview-session-usage) refresh path can still run
  directly after acquiring the write-owner lock; its `--no-sync` path requires
  a daemon.
- If a writable daemon is known to own the local archive but is not reachable,
  session commands report the connection or compatibility error instead of
  opening a second archive handle.
- `session export` always runs locally regardless of daemon state, and rejects
  `--server`, `--pg`, and `--format`/`--json` because it streams raw source
  bytes.

When a discovered local daemon requires auth (`require_auth: true`), the CLI
attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` using the `auth_token` from the shared
config. Explicit `--server` URLs are different: they only receive a bearer token
supplied with `AGENTSVIEW_SERVER_TOKEN` or `--server-token-file <path>`, so a
local daemon token is not leaked to arbitrary remote URLs. Prefer
`--server-token-file` for long-running commands and shared hosts so the token
does not appear in process arguments.

`--pg` opens the configured PostgreSQL read store directly. It is useful for
automation running away from the UI server, but it is read-only: `session sync`
and `session export` reject it. If `AGENTSVIEW_PG_URL` or `[pg].url` is
configured, read commands still use local SQLite unless `--pg` is supplied.

When the CLI reads through HTTP, session list, detail, sync, and search JSON
include `web_url` links to the selected server's browser view. The links retain
the server's base path and separate the provider and session ID into URL
segments, for example `/sessions/codex/<uuid>`. Use the returned link instead of
constructing one. Direct `--pg` reads omit it because no browser address is
known.

## Common flags

| Flag                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `--format human\|json`       | Output format. Default `human`.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `--json`                     | Alias for `--format json`.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `--server <url>`             | Explicit daemon URL for HTTP-backed operations.                                                                                                                                                |
| `--server-token-file <path>` | Bearer token file for an explicit `--server` URL.                                                                                                                                              |
| `--machine <value>`          | Filter bare Codebuff/Freebuff timestamp resolution to a single machine identity (`local`, a name, or `*`). Default `local`. `session get` only; canonical IDs and other agents are unaffected. |
| `--pg`                       | Read from configured PostgreSQL instead of SQLite.                                                                                                                                             |

## Shared metadata endpoints

The web UI and generated API clients use shared metadata endpoints for filter
options:

```http
GET /api/v1/projects
GET /api/v1/machines
GET /api/v1/branches
GET /api/v1/agents
```

`GET /api/v1/branches` returns distinct `(project, branch)` pairs plus an opaque
`token` field:

```json
{
  "branches": [
    {
      "project": "myapp",
      "branch": "main",
      "token": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Pass the returned token back as the `git_branch` query parameter on branch-aware
endpoints. Treat it as opaque and URL-encode it in manual HTTP calls. The token
is scoped by both project and branch, so `app-a/main` and `app-b/main` remain
distinct, and an empty branch remains distinct from a literal `unknown` branch.

## Commands

### `agentsview session get`

Return session metadata plus computed signal fields. Shape matches
`GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}`.

```bash
agentsview session get <id> [--format json]
```

**Bare timestamps on remote stores.** Codebuff/Freebuff sessions live as
`<agent>:<project>:<timestamp>` canonical IDs; a bare timestamp (e.g.
`2026-07-16T00-09-00.236Z`) is not a canonical ID. Against the local archive the
CLI resolves a bare timestamp to its canonical ID by walking the configured
codebuff/freebuff roots, gated by `--machine` (default `local`). Against a
remote store (`--server`, `--pg`) a bare Codebuff/Freebuff timestamp is rejected
with an explicit error pointing at `session list`, because a bare timestamp is
intrinsically ambiguous across machines and projects. The rejection is scoped to
the Codebuff/Freebuff timestamp shape; bare IDs that are not timestamps (Codex /
Copilot / Gemini UUIDs, etc.) are unaffected and continue to resolve via the
registered agent prefix retry on remote reads, the same way they do locally.
Always pass the full canonical ID on remote reads when one is known:

```bash
# Local reads: bare timestamp OK (--machine=local by default).
agentsview session get 2026-07-16T00-09-00.236Z
agentsview session get 2026-07-16T00-09-00.236Z --machine=*

# Remote reads: pass the canonical ID from `session list`.
agentsview session get codebuff:myproject:1704067200 --pg
agentsview session get freebuff:myproject:1704067200 --pg
agentsview session get host~codebuff:myproject:1704067200 --server http://remote
agentsview session get host~freebuff:myproject:1704067200 --server http://remote
```

```json
{
  "id": "abc-123",
  "project": "myapp",
  "machine": "workstation",
  "agent": "claude",
  "first_message": "...",
  "display_name": "...",
  "git_branch": "main",
  "started_at": "2026-04-18T12:00:00Z",
  "ended_at": "2026-04-18T13:00:00Z",
  "message_count": 42,
  "user_message_count": 7,
  "health_score": 85,
  "health_grade": "A",
  "outcome": "completed",
  "health_score_basis": ["..."],
  "health_penalties": {"tool_retries": 5},
  "parser_malformed_lines": 3,
  "secret_leak_count": 0
}
```

`health_score_basis` and `health_penalties` are populated when `health_score` is
non-null. Both HTTP and CLI surfaces return them.

`git_branch` is the branch captured at sync time when the parser or source
metadata exposes it; sessions with no recorded branch omit the field.
`parser_malformed_lines` counts the malformed source lines a parser skipped
while still recovering the session and is omitted when zero. Antigravity detail
responses may also include `decode_confidence`; the value `low` means the
session came from an unrecognized Antigravity schema fingerprint and was decoded
heuristically.

`secret_leak_count` (added in 0.30.0) counts definite-tier findings from
[secret scanning](#secret-scanning) and is stamped inline during sync.
Candidate-tier findings only show up after an explicit
[`agentsview secrets scan --backfill`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-secrets) and
do not contribute to this count.

### `agentsview session list`

Filtered session list. The session fields match `GET /api/v1/sessions`; CLI JSON
also includes a `machine_labels` catalog.

```bash
agentsview session list [flags]
```

```json
{
  "sessions": [ ... ],
  "next_cursor": "...",
  "total": 42,
  "machine_labels": {
    "machine-key": "Build Host"
  }
}
```

One-shot and automated sessions are excluded by default. When the first CLI page
hides any, `session list` writes an advisory to stderr with the hidden count for
each category and the `--include-one-shot` or `--include-automated` flag that
reveals it. Human stdout stays unchanged, and the JSON catalog is additive, so
redirecting or piping structured output remains safe. The JSON `total` continues
to describe the filtered result, not the excluded sessions. Use the
`--include-*` flags to opt back in.

In JSON output, `sessions[].machine` keeps the machine key. Look it up in the
top-level `machine_labels` map when a display name is needed. A key without a
stored label is absent from the map, and labels for machines outside the current
page are omitted. If the catalog cannot be read, the command keeps the session
result and emits `machine_labels: {}` with a warning on stderr. Human output
does not read the catalog.

Use `session list --json --include-source` to include each session's recorded
`file_path`. Paths are omitted by default; this option does not add a column to
human output. HTTP callers use `include_source=true`.

Date filters match a session when its activity window overlaps the selected date
or range. Sessions that start before midnight and remain active after it
therefore appear on both dates.

Sort keys are `recent`, `started`, `messages`, `user-messages`, `output-tokens`,
`peak-context`, `failures`, `retries`, `edit-churn`, `compactions`,
`context-pressure`, `health`, `secrets`, and `id`. `recent` defaults descending;
the other keys default ascending unless `--reverse`, `descending=true`, or an
explicit suffix overrides them.

Human CLI output is formatted for resuming work: it shows the full session ID,
age, agent, project, branch, message count, title, and working directory, with a
marker on sessions active in the last 15 minutes. `--resume` and `--active` set
`active_since` to that 15-minute window unless `--active-since` is supplied
explicitly. HTTP callers should pass `active_since` directly.

Examples:

```bash
agentsview session list --resume
agentsview session list --sort messages:desc,started:asc
agentsview session list --sort health --reverse
```

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview session messages`

Return a window of messages. Response shape matches
`GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/messages`.

```bash
agentsview session messages <id> [--from N] [--limit N] [--direction asc|desc]
agentsview session messages <id> --around N [--before N] [--after N] [--role user,assistant]
```

`--from` is pointer-valued at the service layer: omitting it means "start at the
beginning" for ascending and "start at the newest page" for descending; an
explicit `--from 0` means "start at ordinal 0" in both directions. `--direction`
is validated to `asc` or `desc`.

Window and role flags (see
[Semantic Search](/docs/semantic-search/#cursor-follow-from-a-hit-to-its-surrounding-conversation)
for the cursor-follow workflow they support):

| Flag       | HTTP param | Notes                                                                           |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--around` | `around`   | Center a window on this ordinal; mutually exclusive with `--from`/`--direction` |
| `--before` | `before`   | Messages before the anchor (default 5); requires `--around`                     |
| `--after`  | `after`    | Messages after the anchor (default 5); requires `--around`                      |
| `--role`   | `roles`    | Comma-separated roles to include, e.g. `user,assistant`                         |

With a `--role` filter, `--before`/`--after` count filtered messages; the anchor
message is always included. Responses report the window's
`first_ordinal`/`last_ordinal` so callers can continue paging with
`--from <last_ordinal + 1>`.

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "ordinal": 0,
      "role": "user",
      "content": "...",
      "thinking_text": "",
      "timestamp": "2026-04-18T12:00:00Z",
      "is_system": false,
      "source_type": "user",
      "source_subtype": "",
      "has_thinking": false,
      "has_tool_use": false
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

`thinking_text` holds the concatenated text of any `thinking` blocks the agent
emitted, separated from the flattened `content` which still contains inline
`[Thinking]...[/Thinking]` markers for UI rendering.

Promoted `source_subtype` values on `is_system: true` messages: `continuation`,
`resume`, `interrupted`, `task_notification`, `stop_hook`, `compact_boundary`.

### `agentsview session tool-calls`

Chronological flattened list of tool invocations.

```bash
agentsview session tool-calls <id>
```

```json
{
  "tool_calls": [
    {
      "ordinal": 3,
      "timestamp": "2026-04-18T12:05:00Z",
      "tool_use_id": "toolu_01abc...",
      "tool_name": "Bash",
      "category": "Bash",
      "input_json": "{\"command\":\"ls\"}",
      "skill_name": "",
      "subagent_session_id": "",
      "result_length": 128
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

`input_json` is a string — usually a serialized JSON object but may be a plain
string (e.g. `"echo hello world"` from Codex).

______________________________________________________________________

### `POST /api/v1/sessions/{id}/resume`

Resume a local session in its native agent, or return the command that would be
launched. This is an HTTP-only surface used by the web UI's resume menu.

```http
POST /api/v1/sessions/{id}/resume
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "skip_permissions": false,
  "fork_session": false,
  "from_ordinal": 17,
  "command_only": false,
  "opener_id": ""
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "launched": true,
  "terminal": "Terminal",
  "command": "cd /repo && claude --resume abc-123",
  "cwd": "/repo"
}
```

`command_only: true` returns the command without launching a terminal. When a
launch is attempted but fails, the response still includes the command with
`launched: false` and an `error` code of `no_terminal_found` or `launch_failed`.
Read-only local mode can still return commands, but remote sessions and
read-only remote serving cannot launch local programs.

For Claude Code sessions, setting `fork_session: true` without `from_ordinal`
appends Claude's native `--fork-session` flag to the normal resume command.
Setting both `fork_session: true` and `from_ordinal` creates a message-point
fork: AgentsView renders the transcript through that message ordinal into a
temporary prompt and runs `claude < prompt` from the resolved session working
directory. Message-point forks are Claude-only, require `fork_session`, reject
`opener_id`, and return `404` when the ordinal is not present.

______________________________________________________________________

### The `agentsview://` URL scheme

The desktop app registers the `agentsview://` URL scheme, letting
external tools open a session in the app without going through HTTP:

```bash
open "agentsview://sessions/<session-id>"
```

Contract:

- Only `agentsview://sessions/<session-id>` URLs are accepted. The
  session id must be a single path segment; percent-encode reserved
  characters. Anything else is logged to the desktop log and ignored.
- An optional `?msg=<ordinal>` or `?msg=last` query scrolls to that
  message. Other query parameters are dropped.
- If the app is running, its window is focused and navigated to the
  session. If not, the app launches and opens the session once its
  backend is ready. On Windows and Linux a second launch forwards its
  URL to the running instance and exits.
- Callers can detect a missing handler because `open` (macOS) and
  equivalent launchers exit non-zero when no app claims the scheme;
  fall back to the web UI at
  `http://<host>:<port>/sessions/<session-id>` in that case.

The scheme is registered by the installed desktop app; it is not
available when only the CLI or server is installed.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview session export`

Stream the raw session source file to stdout. This is a **local-only**
filesystem helper: the source file path is resolved from the local SQLite
archive, never from any daemon. Both `--server` and `--format`/`--json` are
rejected with an error — the command also rejects `--pg`. It streams raw bytes,
so structured-output and remote-store flags don't apply.

```bash
agentsview session export <id>
```

Exit states:

| State                                  | Behavior                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Session in local archive, file on disk | Streams bytes verbatim                           |
| Session in local archive, file missing | Exit 1: error prefixed `source file not found`   |
| Session in local archive, path empty   | Exit 1: `source file not found for session <id>` |
| Session not in local archive           | Exit 1: `session not in local archive: <id>`     |

For a DB-derived export (HTML or markdown) use the HTTP endpoints
`/api/v1/sessions/{id}/export` or `/api/v1/sessions/{id}/md`.

Markdown export accepts an optional `depth` query parameter:

- omitted: root session only
- `depth=1`: include direct child/subagent sessions
- `depth=all`: recurse through the child-session tree

Any other `depth` value is rejected.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview session sync`

Parse and insert a single session. Blocks until indexing and signal computation
complete. JSON output is the `SessionDetail` of the synced session; human output
is one line: `synced: <id>`.

```bash
agentsview session sync <path-or-id>
```

Argument resolution: if the argument is an existing filesystem path, it is
treated as a raw JSONL file to parse. Otherwise it is treated as a session ID
for re-parse.

With `--server <url>`, path-shaped arguments such as
`/var/log/agent/session.jsonl` or `./session.jsonl` are sent to the remote
daemon as paths and resolved on that daemon host. Bare values without path
separators are treated as session IDs.

When a single JSONL maps to more than one session (for example a Claude
transcript with forked/resumed branches), `session sync <path>` refuses with an
error that lists every candidate id. The contract is "one session in, one
`SessionDetail` back", so the CLI never picks arbitrarily.

At that point the file has already been parsed and every candidate session
written to the local archive — the ambiguity check runs after the sync engine
finishes. Re-run `session sync <id>` with the specific session you want; the
`<id>` form resolves the file path from the archive, so it only works for
sessions already present there.

- `session sync` uses a writable local daemon when one is running, or starts a
  detached daemon when no compatible daemon is running. It then proxies to
  `POST /api/v1/sessions/sync` so parsing and signal computation remain
  daemon-owned.
- If a [`pg serve`](/docs/pg-sync/#agentsview-pg-serve) daemon is running
  (read-only), sync refuses with a clear error.
- If `AGENTSVIEW_NO_DAEMON=1` is set, the CLI runs the sync in-process only
  after acquiring the local write-owner lock.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview session watch`

Stream NDJSON events as the session updates. Each line is a small object that
wraps an SSE event.

```bash
agentsview session watch <id>
```

```
{"event":"session_updated","data":"abc-123"}
{"event":"heartbeat","data":"2026-04-18T12:05:00Z"}
```

Recognized `event` values today: `session_updated`, `heartbeat`. New events may
be added; consumers should ignore unknown events. The command runs until
interrupted (Ctrl+C) or the context is cancelled. Like `session export`, it
streams a fixed format and rejects `--format`/`--json`.

Watch validates the session id before opening the stream. An unknown id fails
fast with a `watch: session not found: <id>` error and non-zero exit instead of
producing an indefinite heartbeat stream — typos in automation scripts surface
immediately. When proxied to a daemon, the same condition surfaces as HTTP 404
at the transport layer before being translated to the CLI error.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview session search`

Substring, RE2 regex, or FTS5 search across message bodies, tool inputs, and
tool result content. Response shape matches `GET /api/v1/search/content`.

```bash
agentsview session search <pattern> [flags]
```

```json
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "session_id": "abc-123",
      "project": "myapp",
      "ordinal": 17,
      "ordinal_range": [12, 24],
      "location": "tool_result",
      "tool_name": "Bash",
      "snippet": "...connecting to db with token ***REDACTED***..."
    }
  ]
}
```

One-shot, automated, and subagent sessions are excluded by default; opt back in
with `--include-one-shot`, `--include-automated`, or `--include-children`.

`--regex`, `--fts`, `--semantic`, and `--hybrid` are mutually exclusive. `--fts`
is the fastest mode on large archives but only searches message bodies;
substring (the default) and regex modes also walk `tool_calls.input_json`,
`tool_calls.result_content`, and the `tool_result_events` rows. `--semantic` and
`--hybrid` require an embedding index and return a single ranked page
(`--cursor` is rejected) — see [Semantic Search](/docs/semantic-search/) for
setup, scoring, and limitations.

Every match, in every mode, carries the conversation-unit citation described in
[Hit shape](/docs/semantic-search/#hit-shape-ranges-and-anchors):
`ordinal_range` — `[start, end]` of the conversation unit containing the match,
always present, `[ordinal, ordinal]` when the match is its own unit — plus the
lineage fields `subordinate`, `relationship`, `parent_session_id`, and
`is_sidechain`. `ordinal` stays the anchor (the exact matched message) in every
mode. Only the lineage fields are `omitempty`: a missing key unambiguously means
top-level with no lineage, while `ordinal_range` is never omitted, even at
`[0, 0]`. `score` is the one field only `--semantic`/`--hybrid` emit. `--scope`
is rejected outside `--semantic`/`--hybrid`; in those modes it supersedes
`--include-children`, and subagent/fork-typed or parent-linked sessions are
exempt from the default one-shot exclusion.

Snippets carry ~60 characters of context on each side of the match, snapped to
rune boundaries. Any substring that matches the
[secret scanner](#secret-scanning) rule set is masked unless `--reveal` is
passed. The same masking applies to the HTTP endpoint when called from a remote
origin — `reveal=true` is only honored on a localhost-bound daemon.

### `agentsview session usage`

Per-session token usage and cost estimate. Output shape is stable for the fields
shown below; new fields may be added.

Totals cover the named session **and every subagent transcript spawned beneath
it**. Claude Code writes each Task-tool subagent to its own file under
`<session>/subagents/`, which agentsview ingests as a separate session;
reporting only the parent's own rows understated its cost by up to 77% in real
sessions. Attribution happens at read time — no rollup is persisted, no child
row is duplicated under the parent, and daily/activity aggregates (which already
count subagent sessions as first-class spend) are unaffected. Pass `--own-only`
to report just the named transcript's rows, which is the pre-0.40.0 output.

The REST endpoint is `GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/usage`, and it is own-session by
default. Two query params widen it, and they are not composable: if both are
passed, `rollup=true` takes precedence and `subagents` is ignored for that
request.

- `?subagents=true` folds descendant usage into `cost`, `total_output_tokens`,
  `models`, `breakdown`, and `breakdown_count`, and adds `subagent_count`.
  This is what the CLI requests.
- `?rollup=true` keeps the totals own-session and reports the combined cost in
  the separate `rollup_*` fields below. The session detail header uses this
  form. When both `rollup=true` and `subagents=true` are passed, the handler
  returns from the rollup branch first, so `subagents` has no effect.

Claude Code echoes some parent turns into a subagent's sidechain transcript, so
the same message can appear in two sessions. Every combined figure counts it
once: `cost`, `total_output_tokens`, `breakdown`, and `breakdown_count` are all
derived from one deduplicated row set, so they agree with each other and with
the day aggregates. This is why the combined `total_output_tokens` can be lower
than the sum of the included sessions' individual `total_output_tokens` — each
of those is derived from its own transcript in isolation and still contains the
echo. A session with no per-message usage rows contributes its session-level
total instead, since it has nothing to deduplicate against.

Each `breakdown` row carries the fields shown in the example:

| `cost`                | Per-row integer microdollar object; includes the web search fee when `web_search_requests` is present and the row's cost is computed. A row with an authoritative reported cost is assumed to already settle its own server tool use, so the fee is not added on top even when `web_search_requests` is present. Zero with `has_cost: false` when the model is unpriced and the row performed no web search; an unpriced computed row that did still reports the fee, because the fee does not depend on token rates |

Human output is a compact summary:

```
Session:       abc-123
Agent:         claude
Output:        15230
Peak ctx:      84000
Subagents:     2 (included)
Cost:          ~$2.41 (claude-opus-4-7)
```

The `Subagents` line appears only when the figures cover subagent transcripts,
so a session without them (or a `--own-only` run) prints the same five lines it
always has.

The leading `~` on the cost line marks a computed or mixed figure. A reported
cost omits it. The parenthesized model list is shown only when contributing
models exist, so a cost-only reported session does not render empty parentheses.
When some contributing models are unpriced, the cost line reads
`n/a (unpriced: model-x)`; when the session has no token data at all, it reads
`n/a`. Priced Copilot-family sessions add an `AI Credits` line after the cost.

**HTTP endpoint** — as of 0.32.0, the same data is available over REST:

```http
GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/usage
```

The response uses the same JSON fields shown above and is available from both
local SQLite-backed `agentsview serve` and read-only
[`agentsview pg serve`](/docs/pg-sync/#agentsview-pg-serve). HTTP responses set
`server_running: true`. As of 0.37.1, pass `?breakdown=true` to include the
per-step `breakdown` rows; without it `breakdown` is `[]` while
`breakdown_count` still reports the row count. The CLI requests the breakdown on
every path (local, `--server`, and `--pg`), so its `--format json` output always
includes the rows; it also passes `subagents=true` unless `--own-only` was
given, so the three backends return the same document. The session detail header
uses this endpoint to render its
[per-step usage breakdown](/docs/usage/#token-usage). Existing sessions return
`200 OK` even when token or cost data is absent; inspect `has_token_data`,
`has_cost`, and `unpriced_models` to decide how to present that state. Missing
sessions return `404` with:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "session_not_found",
    "message": "session not found"
  }
}
```

Unexpected usage-query failures return `500` with
`error.code = "usage_query_failed"`.

**Exit codes** — `usage` keeps the older `token-use` contract:

| Code | Meaning                                            |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | Token data or cost present and reported            |
| `2`  | Session not found in the local archive             |
| `3`  | Session exists but has neither token data nor cost |

The codes classify the reported document, so a session whose only token data
lives in its subagents exits `0`, not `3`. With `--own-only` it exits `3`, as it
did before.

Before querying, the local backend refreshes the session's own transcript and
the `agent-*.jsonl` files under its `subagents/` directory, so a session that
just finished reports complete numbers. `--own-only` skips the subagent refresh.

Pass `--no-sync` to read archived usage without refreshing source transcripts.
This preserves the full subagent rollup and the exit codes above; combine it
with `--own-only` only when you want to exclude subagents. Local and remote
HTTP queries skip the sync request, so recent usage appears after the watcher
or a separate sync has indexed it. PostgreSQL reads already use archived data.
The local `--no-sync` path requires a compatible daemon and starts one with
source synchronization disabled if needed. With `AGENTSVIEW_NO_DAEMON=1`,
it requires an existing compatible daemon.

The command uses a writable local daemon when one is running, or starts a
detached daemon when fresh local data is needed and no compatible daemon is
running. Without `--no-sync`, `AGENTSVIEW_NO_DAEMON=1` selects direct local SQLite
after acquiring the write-owner lock for any required refresh. Configured
PostgreSQL does not change this command's default local behavior; pass `--pg` to
read usage from the shared PostgreSQL store. With `--server`, it calls
`GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/usage` on the explicit daemon. With `--pg`, it reads
usage from the shared PostgreSQL store.

Pricing comes from the same `model_pricing` table and
[custom pricing overrides](/docs/token-usage/#custom-model-pricing) that back
`agentsview usage daily`. Replaces the older
[`agentsview token-use`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-token-use), which remains as
a deprecated alias.

## Activity Report

The Activity report endpoint powers the top-level [Activity](/docs/activity/)
page and the `agentsview activity report` CLI command. It returns one resolved
range with concurrency buckets, summary totals, breakdowns, and contributing
sessions.

```http
GET /api/v1/activity/report
GET /api/v1/activity/report/{report_id}/sessions
```

Session-page responses omit the complete report by default so browser sorting,
bucket filtering, and pagination stay page-bounded. Stateless clients can add
`include_report=true`; a `refresh_required` response includes its complete
replacement report regardless.

Activity includes one-shot sessions by default. Automated sessions are also
included by default and can be filtered with the `automation` query parameter.

The JSON response shares the same `schema_version`, `pricing`, and `projects`
metadata contract as `agentsview activity report --json`.

The report route negotiates its response with `Accept`. Ordinary clients receive
plain JSON. Clients requesting `text/event-stream` receive throttled `progress`
events followed by one terminal `report` event. Both forms use the long-running
route and are not subject to the ordinary 30-second operation timeout.

| Query param  | Notes                                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `preset`     | `day`, `week`, `month`, or `custom`                        |
| `date`       | Anchor date for day/week/month presets (`YYYY-MM-DD`)      |
| `from`       | Custom range start, RFC3339                                |
| `to`         | Custom range end, RFC3339                                  |
| `timezone`   | IANA timezone name; default `UTC`                          |
| `bucket`     | Optional bucket override: `5m`, `15m`, `1h`, `1d`, or `1w` |
| `project`    | Filter by project                                          |
| `git_branch` | Filter by opaque branch token from `GET /api/v1/branches`  |
| `agent`      | Filter by agent                                            |
| `machine`    | Filter by machine                                          |
| `automation` | `all`, `interactive`, or `automated`; default `all`        |

Project, branch, agent, and machine filters are limited to 1,024 UTF-8 bytes
each and 3,072 bytes combined. The fully encoded signed report ID is also
validated before aggregation so JSON escaping cannot overflow the session-page
URL token.

Breakdown rows include total, automated, and interactive minutes and costs.
Session rows with no reliable timestamped activity use
`"timing_quality": "untimed"` and `agent_minutes: null`; they can still
contribute cost and output tokens when usage rows exist.

Schema v6 returns at most the first 200 session rows in `by_session` and no
longer returns raw activity intervals. Fetch later pages, alternate sorts, or a
bucket drill-down through the sessions endpoint. It accepts `limit` (default
200, maximum 500), `cursor`, `sort`, `direction`, and the zero-based half-open
range `bucket_start` and `bucket_end`. Both range bounds must be present. If the
archive changed since the signed `report_id` was created, the response sets
`refresh_required` and includes a complete replacement `report` so clients never
combine different report generations.

## Secret Scanning

As of 0.30.0, AgentsView scans session content for credentials during sync and
exposes findings through CLI, HTTP, and per- session metadata. Two confidence
tiers exist:

| Tier          | Rules                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | When scanned                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definite**  | Well-anchored vendor formats: AWS access keys, Anthropic `sk-ant-…`, OpenAI `sk-proj-`/`sk-svcacct-`/`sk-admin-`, GitHub `ghp_…` and `github_pat_…`, GitLab `glpat-…`, Slack `xoxb`/`xoxa`/`xoxp`/`xoxr`/`xoxs`, Stripe `sk_live_…` and `rk_live_…`, Google `AIza…`, npm `npm_…`, PyPI `pypi-…`, Hugging Face `hf_…`, SendGrid `SG.…`, PEM private-key blocks | Inline during sync                                  |
| **Candidate** | FP-prone heuristics: basic-auth URLs, JWTs, high-entropy assignments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Only when `agentsview secrets scan` runs explicitly |

Findings are written to a `secret_findings` table keyed by session ID, with the
rule name, confidence, location (message / tool_input / tool_result /
tool_result_event), match coordinates, and a `redacted_match` value (the raw
secret is never stored). Each session also carries a `secret_leak_count` and a
`secrets_rules_version` so a future ruleset bump can drive an incremental
backfill.

### HTTP API

```
GET /api/v1/secrets
POST /api/v1/secrets/scan
GET /api/v1/search/content    (when called with text that matches a secret rule, snippets are masked)
```

`GET /api/v1/secrets` accepts: `project`, `agent`, `date_from`, `date_to`,
`rule`, `confidence` (`definite` / `candidate` / `all`, default `definite`),
`reveal`, `limit`, `cursor`. `reveal=true` is only honored on a localhost-bound
daemon — remote callers that request reveal receive HTTP 403.

`POST /api/v1/secrets/scan` streams progress with Server-Sent Events and accepts
`backfill`, `project`, `agent`, `date_from`, and `date_to`. It is only available
from a writable local daemon.

### Listing sessions with findings

`agentsview session list --has-secret` (or `has_secret=true` on
`GET /api/v1/sessions`) returns only sessions with at least one definite
finding. The candidate tier does not contribute to `secret_leak_count` and so
does not surface through this filter.

### CLI

The [`agentsview secrets`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-secrets) command group
wraps the scan and list operations. The fast path is:

```bash
# Re-scan the archive with the full ruleset (definite + candidate)
agentsview secrets scan

# List definite findings (redacted; localhost-only --reveal for raw values)
agentsview secrets list
agentsview secrets list --reveal
```

### PostgreSQL parity

When [PostgreSQL sync](/docs/pg-sync/) is enabled, the `secret_findings` table,
the session-level `secret_leak_count`, and the `--has-secret` filter all mirror
to the shared database. Substring and regex content search work the same way
against `pg serve`, with the same masking and `--reveal` constraints.

### Ingest-time image offload

The normalized Markdown endpoint `/api/v1/sessions/{id}/md` carries stored tool-result content, including `agentsview_image` placeholders and `image_ref` asset references. The HTML export keeps its existing contract. A serving host needs the matching `{dataDir}/assets` directory. PostgreSQL and CockroachDB retain the reference text but cannot resolve local assets. The raw `agentsview session export` command streams provider source bytes and retains their original inline payloads.

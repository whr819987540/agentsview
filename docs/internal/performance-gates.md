# Performance Gates

agentsview has repeatedly shipped performance regressions where sync work
stopped scaling with *new data* and started scaling with *archive size*. This
document records the regression classes we have actually hit, the deterministic
tests that guard them, and optional local benchmark comparisons. Benchmark
ratios no longer block pull requests.

The watcher scheduler, bounded watcher batches, and Codex continuation cursor
contracts are documented in
[Background Sync Efficiency](background-sync-efficiency.md).

## Regression history

## Automated invariants and local benchmarks

### 1. Deterministic work-count invariants (run in `make test`)

These count work units instead of measuring time, so they are immune to CI
runner noise and fail loudly:

- `TestWarmFullSyncDoesNoBulkWriteWork` (`internal/sync/perf_invariant_test.go`)
  — a second full sync over an unchanged Claude archive must skip everything
  and run zero bulk-write batches (`Engine.PhaseStats`).
- `TestProviderAuthoritativeUnchangedSessionSkipsOnResync`
  (`internal/sync/provider_freshness_integration_test.go`) — the generic
  freshness skip for provider-authoritative agents, Vibe as representative.
- `TestWriteIncrementalDebouncesSignalRecompute` and the rest of
  `internal/sync/signal_schedule_test.go` — streaming appends must debounce
  the O(history) signal recompute.
- `TestCodexCheckpoint*` in `internal/sync/checkpoint_test.go` — a full Codex
  parse persists a checkpoint, an append resumes from it and advances it
  atomically with the delta, truncation/anchor mismatch force an authoritative
  rebuild, and an unchanged checkpointed source is trusted on stat alone
  (append-trust; the audit path still catches rewrites).
- `TestCodexCheckpointStaleCannotResumeFromNewerDBOffset`,
  `TestCodexCheckpointHashStateBoundedToCommittedOffset`,
  `TestCodexCheckpointColdRestartResumeParity`, and
  `TestCodexCheckpointAuditRepairsSameStatRewrite`
  (`internal/sync/checkpoint_review_test.go`) — a surviving checkpoint must
  agree with the committed DB offset/ordinal/hash, hash state covers exactly
  the committed prefix, cold restarts resume with parity, and the audit
  repairs same-stat rewrites.
- `TestParserCheckpointRoundTrip` and
  `TestWriteSessionIncrementalPersistsCheckpointInSameTx` (`internal/db`) —
  checkpoint rows round-trip and are committed in the same transaction as the
  incremental delta.
- `TestFullSyncPassIsByteBudgeted`,
  `TestBulkParseRetentionBudgetUsesWeightedAdmission`, and
  `TestCollectAndBatchFlushesOnByteCap` (`internal/sync`) — bulk passes and
  write batches are bounded by estimated bytes, not session count alone.
- The count-based seam tests in `internal/parser`
  (`discovery_workspace_manifest_test.go`, gemini/antigravity provider tests)
  — root-derived project info is built once per root, not once per source.
- `internal/server/broadcaster_test.go` — SSE emits coalesce to at most one
  broadcast per window.
- `TestWatcherBatchesPathsAndEnforcesDispatchFloor`,
  `TestWatcherSustainedWritesProgress`,
  `TestWatcherContinuesIntakeDuringCallback`, and
  `TestWatcherOverflowRunsFullSyncThenRetainsLaterBatch`
  (`internal/sync/watcher_test.go`) — watcher callbacks remain throttled and
  serialized, sustained writes make progress, event intake continues during a
  sync, and an event storm becomes a bounded full rescan.
- `TestCodexCursorCache`, `TestCodexCursorWarmColdParity`, and the cursor
  boundary tests in `internal/parser` — continuation state stays bounded and
  warm/cold parsing remains equivalent at safe offsets.
- `TestIncrementalSync_CodexAppend`,
  `TestIncrementalSync_CodexLifecycleTailUpdatesTermination`, the partial-tail
  tests, the late tool-result append test
  (`TestIncrementalSync_CodexExecAppendRetainsEvents`), and the
  late-update/title tests in `internal/sync/engine_integration_test.go` — safe
  Codex growth appends only new rows, late tool results update stored calls in
  place, and lifecycle metadata, incomplete records, title changes, and other
  retroactive updates preserve full-parse behavior.
- `TestCountDuplicatePromptsAllocationGrowthStaysNearLinear`
  (`internal/signals/heuristics_test.go`) — session-quality analysis must not
  rebuild token sets for every pair of user prompts.

When you fix a performance bug, prefer adding a gate at this layer: expose or
reuse a counter (`SyncStats`, `PhaseStats`, `AnomalyStats`, a swappable
package-var seam) and assert the invariant, e.g. "second sync parses zero
sessions" or "the manifest is read once per root regardless of session count".

### 2. Optional local benchmark comparisons

The benchmark gate workflows have been removed. The `make bench-gate` target and
`cmd/benchgate` remain available for local comparisons. The target defines the
package list, sample count, and per-tier iteration counts for these benchmarks:

- `BenchmarkSyncAllWarmNoop` — full sync over an already-synced archive (stat +
  skip work only; also self-asserts nothing is re-synced or bulk-rewritten).
- `BenchmarkSyncPathsIncrementalAppend` — absorb one appended line into a
  1,000-message session.
- `BenchmarkCodexCheckpointAppendResume` — the source-reading pipeline of a
  checkpoint-resumed Codex append: checkpoint gate (stat + anchor digest +
  fingerprint resume), seeded tail parse, committed-prefix resume hash, next
  anchor digest, and next checkpoint assembly. Bounded by the anchor window
  plus the tail — see
  [Background Sync Efficiency](background-sync-efficiency.md) for the cost-model
  boundary.
- `BenchmarkCodexLateToolOutputDebouncedBurst` — a checkpoint-resumed Codex
  append stream with the signal debounce stretched, so only the first
  iteration pays the O(history) recompute and the rest are amortized. It
  guards the late-result update path's per-append cost; it is deliberately NOT
  the quiet-session gate (see the `BenchmarkCodexQuietAppendSignals*` trio
  below).
- `BenchmarkCodexQuietAppendSignals500` / `...5000` / `...15000` — the
  non-amortized quiet-session append gate: every iteration appends a new
  function_call plus the previous call's late output and pays the full inline
  signal/secret maintenance (debounce disabled). The three sizes prove
  per-append latency does not scale with stored history; each self-asserts
  zero `GetAllMessages` calls in the timed loop.
- `BenchmarkCodexColdFullSync` — a fresh database and engine ingesting the
  transcript from scratch, including the single-pass checkpoint capture.
  Per-op cost deliberately exceeds the micro-benchmark band; it exists to
  catch a regression that adds a source read pass to the cold pipeline.
- `BenchmarkSyncAllColdArchive` — first-sync ingest throughput through the
  default per-session write path.
- `BenchmarkResyncBulkIngest` — the same archive through the resync bulk-write
  pipeline (`writeBatchBulk` / `DB.WriteSessionBatch`, the #411 regression
  class); self-asserts every session took the batch path.
- `BenchmarkReplaceSessionMessagesStreamingMerge` — the streaming chunk-merge
  diff path (one UPDATE, not a full delete+reinsert).
- `BenchmarkInsertMessagesBatch` — multi-row batched ingest.
- `BenchmarkResyncBulkContributorIngest` — the same archive entering the atomic
  rebuild through a contributor engine.
- `BenchmarkSearchContentSubstringPage` / `BenchmarkSearchContentFTSPage` — one
  page of content search through the substring and FTS paths.
- `BenchmarkPersistUnchangedSkipCache` — repeated persistence of an unchanged
  10k-entry skip cache must avoid copying the map and rewriting its rows.
- `BenchmarkGetStats` — the repeatedly polled sidebar totals over 10k sessions.
  Computes all totals together so a refresh scans filtered sessions once.
- `BenchmarkGetDailyUsage` — usage aggregation over 100k message rows. The usage
  aggregate implementation keeps this benchmark name so the gate compares it
  with the merge-base request path. Its warm cases must scan no normalized
  facts and scale with aggregate plus exceptional rows.
- `BenchmarkSQLiteActivityReportCandidateSource100K`,
  `BenchmarkSQLiteActivityReportCandidateSourceLongSession`, and
  `BenchmarkSQLiteActivityReportArtifacts100K` — activity-report candidate
  streaming and artifact building over 100k sessions or a 100k-message
  session.
- `BenchmarkScan` / `BenchmarkScanDefinite` — secret-scan regex throughput.
- `BenchmarkCountDuplicatePromptsLargeSession` — duplicate-prompt analysis over
  a long session with shared vocabulary and distinct prompt context.

`benchgate` builds on `golang.org/x/perf`: `benchfmt` parses the output and
`benchmath` — the statistics engine behind `benchstat` — summarizes samples and
tests significance (Mann-Whitney U). benchgate adds only the policy benchstat
does not provide: thresholds, floors, and a failing exit code. Gating is per
benchmark — any single benchmark over its threshold fails the comparison.
Nothing is averaged across benchmarks. It gates hard on `allocs/op` (limit
1.25x), which is deterministic for the same code and iteration count — an
O(archive)-instead-of-O(delta) regression always blows it up. It compares the
candidate's *worst* `-count` run against the baseline median, so even an
intermittent extra-allocation path fails. That is intentionally asymmetric: the
baseline is treated as the historical reference, and candidate instability is
what fails the comparison (failure lines include the baseline's worst run so
pre-existing instability is visible). `B/op` keeps a tight 1.35x limit but
compares medians and must be a statistically significant difference before it
fails. Allocated bytes are not deterministic once the code under test reuses
pooled buffers: `encoding/json` keeps its encoder buffers in a per-processor
`sync.Pool`, so whether a `Marshal` call re-allocates a multi-hundred-kilobyte
buffer depends on which processor the goroutine lands on. The recall evidence
window benchmarks showed this in CI with identical code, spreading `B/op` from
3.6 to 7.9 MiB across five runs while `allocs/op` moved by under one percent.
Time (`sec/op`) compares medians with a loose 2.0x limit and the same
significance requirement, so a single slow run on a noisy runner cannot fail a
comparison but algorithmic blowups still do. Significance gating requires at
least 5 candidate samples; fewer is reported as a configuration error (the
candidate run is under the caller's control), while a baseline with fewer than 5
samples — a legitimately partial base run — is reported and not gated. Baselines
below a per-metric floor are not gated. Benchmarks that exist on only one side
are reported but never fail, so adding or removing benchmarks cannot fail a
comparison. Only `allocs/op`, `B/op`, and `sec/op` are gated: custom
`b.ReportMetric` units are collected and reported as ungated, never enforced.

Two failure modes are treated as loud configuration errors (exit 2) rather than
silent gaps: a capture whose result lines fail to parse, and a gated unit
present in the baseline but missing from the candidate (for example a candidate
captured without `-benchmem`), which would otherwise silently disable that gate
for good. The reverse — a gated unit missing from the baseline, which may
legitimately be older or partial — is reported as not gated.

There is one corruption source we have actually hit. `go test` gives the test
binary a single merged stdout+stderr pipe, and the testing package prints a
benchmark's name before the timed loop and its numbers after, so any log line
the code under test writes in between (the slow `InsertMessages` warning during
fixture seeding on a busy runner, for example) splits the result across two
lines. benchfmt cannot parse either half, the sample disappears, and the gate
fails on the corruption or on having too few samples. Benchmarks therefore send
the package logger through their own `b.Output()`, which the testing package
prints after the result line: `testDB` does it for every `internal/db`
benchmark, and the sync benchmarks call `routeBenchLogs`.

The gate always runs with a fixed `-benchtime=Nx` iteration count (not a
duration): two of the benchmarks grow their fixture as they iterate, so the
baseline and candidate must run the same number of iterations to measure
identical workloads. Iterations come in two tiers. Benchmarks whose single
iteration costs hundreds of milliseconds to seconds (the 100k-row usage and
activity-report fixtures and cold-archive ingest, matched by `BENCH_GATE_HEAVY`)
run in a second `go test` pass with `BENCH_GATE_HEAVY_TIME` iterations; every
other benchmark runs with `BENCH_GATE_TIME`. Per-op ratios at that scale do not
need the averaging that millisecond-scale samples do, and at the full iteration
count those few benchmarks were most of the gate's wall clock.
`BENCH_GATE_COUNT` samples are taken per benchmark, and every sample rebuilds
the fixture, so the count is kept at benchgate's significance minimum. Use
`make bench-gate-config` to obtain the count, both iteration counts, and the
heavy-tier regex. Pass the same values into both runs when defaults differ
between revisions or when you override them.

Report identifiers are package-qualified benchmark names
(`go.kenn.io/agentsview/internal/db.InsertMessagesBatch-18`) when the captured
output carries `pkg:` metadata, falling back to the bare name when it does not
(e.g. hand-trimmed captures). Do not mix captures with and without `pkg:` lines:
the same benchmark would key differently and be treated as removed/new.

Run locally, comparing your working tree against a baseline commit. Use a
worktree for the baseline — checking out or stashing in place can leave
candidate files (or your commits) in the baseline run:

```bash
make bench-gate > new.txt                # candidate: current tree
git worktree add /tmp/bench-base "$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)"
make -C /tmp/bench-base bench-gate > old.txt
git worktree remove /tmp/bench-base
go run ./cmd/benchgate -old old.txt -new new.txt
```

Cross-backend query benchmarks live separately in `internal/backendbench`
(`make bench-backends`, requires Docker) and are not part of `make bench-gate`.

## Usage aggregate release gates

CI uses fixture-based work invariants. Machine-specific targets are manual
release gates on the protected production-scale clone. Run them after cache
statistics maintenance so planner state does not exaggerate the aggregate tier's
benefit.

- Complete warm 30-day CLI result: at most two seconds.
- Warm in-process 30-day result: target 1.5 seconds.
- Report warm 1-day, 7-day, 30-day, and all-history results.
- Report cold timezone/component construction and steady-state rebuild
  throughput separately.
- Report exception group and row counts plus exception-resolution time for
  30-day and all-history reads.
- Newest-first facts plus process-local rollups: complete within 30 seconds.
- Full facts plus process-local rollup coverage: complete within five minutes.

The detailed architecture and oracle requirements are in
[Usage Aggregate Cache](usage-aggregate-cache.md).

`BenchmarkCodexIncrementalCursor` lives in `internal/parser` and compares cold
prefix reconstruction with an exact warm cursor. It is outside the local
comparison target: `BENCH_GATE_PACKAGES` currently contains `./internal/sync`,
`./internal/db`, `./internal/secrets`, and `./internal/signals`.

### 3. Macro ratio gate (run manually, build tag `macrobench`)

The 10MB-vs-1GB same-append p95 ratio (`< 2x`) is not a CI benchmark: the 1GB
fixture takes minutes per run. `internal/sync/codex_macro_bench_test.go` is
excluded from the default local comparison by the `macrobench` build tag:

```bash
cd internal/sync
go test -tags 'fts5,macrobench' -run '^$' \
  -bench 'BenchmarkMacroCodexQuietAppend' -benchmem -count=6 -benchtime=5x
```

The gate: the p95 `sec/op` of `BenchmarkMacroCodexQuietAppend1GB` must stay
within 2x of `BenchmarkMacroCodexQuietAppend10MB` for the same quiet-append
shape (call + late output, full inline signal/secret maintenance).

## Adding a benchmark to local comparisons

`BenchmarkReportingJointDay` compares reporting v3 and v4 at one- and
five-minute resolutions on the same synthetic SQLite archive: 200 sessions,
eight models, three agents, model switches and overlap, with four or 100
projects. It measures snapshot reads, aggregation, canonical digests and
serialization, and reports allocations, bytes and cell count. Compare resolution
independently of project cardinality; sparse cell counts and payload sizes do
not grow in direct proportion to bucket counts. Setup is outside the timer. It
does not measure CLI startup, full-history digest screening or a
production-sized archive. Run it directly with
`go test -tags fts5 ./internal/db -run '^$' -bench '^BenchmarkReportingJointDay$' -benchmem`.

The local comparison includes every benchmark in the selected packages. A
benchmark present in only one revision has no baseline and is reported without a
threshold check.

1. Write the benchmark next to the code it guards (`*_bench_test.go`,
   `b.ReportAllocs()`, self-assert the invariant it protects where possible).
   Anything the code under test logs must go through the benchmark's own
   output (`testDB` does this for `internal/db`; see `routeBenchLogs` in
   `internal/sync/engine_bench_test.go` for the pattern). A log line written
   straight to stderr mid-result corrupts the capture and benchgate fails on
   it.
1. If its package is not already gated, add it to `BENCH_GATE_PACKAGES` in the
   Makefile — a benchmark outside the gated packages silently never runs, so
   it looks included while measuring nothing. Each side of a local comparison
   uses its own commit's package list.
1. Keep per-op cost roughly in the 100µs–100ms band: below the benchgate floors
   nothing is gated, and far above it the job gets slow. A benchmark that
   needs a large fixture to expose per-row scaling belongs in
   `BENCH_GATE_HEAVY` so it runs with the reduced iteration count; a
   fixture-growing benchmark does not, because its per-op cost depends on the
   iteration count. Keep fixture seeding cheap too: it is repeated once per
   `-count` sample.
1. Keep per-iteration setup out of the timed region (`b.ResetTimer`, pre-built
   fixtures): helper allocations inside the loop are gated as if they were
   product cost and dilute or distort the ratio.
1. If the benchmark's fixture grows across iterations, say so in its comment;
   the fixed `-benchtime=Nx` keeps both sides comparable, but readers need to
   know per-op cost depends on the iteration count.

## Synthetic workload simulator

`make perf-sim` runs the retained simulator in `cmd/perfsim`. See
[the simulator guide](performance-simulator.md) for archive-size comparisons,
append-only profiles, and analytic-query measurements. Its small correctness
fixture runs in the normal Go suite. Large runs are opt-in; their process-wide
allocation samples include background work and are not CI timing assertions.

`BenchmarkCodexStreamingDiscovery` in `internal/parser` is a diagnostic
benchmark, like `BenchmarkCodexIncrementalCursor`, outside the default gate
package list. The sync candidate-lookup and unchanged-cache work regressions
also run as deterministic tests in the regular suite.

The simulator's `--source-format opencode` mode covers SQLite metadata and
full-digest scans, active-session polling, container events, and child-only part
edits. `TestOpenCodeVirtualEventDoesNotRecheckUnrelatedMembers` bounds unchanged
virtual-event work as the archive grows and checks deletion behavior.

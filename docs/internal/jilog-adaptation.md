# jilog adaptation provenance

AgentsView's Friction Log adapts the session review from
[jilog](https://github.com/Joi/jilog) at commit `9e8e094` (workspace version
0.8.1). jilog's detectors, thresholds, digest format, and tests are the
behavioral reference. This page records the source, the changes, and the MIT
notice. Source paths below are relative to that jilog commit.

The pure detection, signal, formatting, JSON, archived-row adapter, and session
review packages are built. Persistence, digest rendering, scheduling, NanoClaw
integration, and Kata filing remain planned. Sections marked planned record the
approved mapping, not current behavior.

## Kept

- The correction, error, workaround, deferral, and pattern signal model
  (`crates/jilog-review/src/signal.rs:6-219`) maps to `friction.Signal`.
- Coding and chat correction detection keeps the window, length limits and
  ten chat marker patterns (`crates/jilog-review/src/detectors.rs:89-176`).
- Error detection keeps one signal per failed tool result and the content-free
  `bash` rule (`detectors.rs:205-488`): a failure whose text is blank or only
  the timeout sentence is expected noise. The caller marks failed calls and
  passes their result text, so there is no JSON envelope to parse.
- Workaround and deferral detection keeps the eight and nine patterns and
  labels, respectively (`detectors.rs:31-78,504-601`).
- P0 alerts require at least three distinct root sessions per tool
  (`detectors.rs:81,609-633`). Operational diagnostics remain excluded by
  subject kind, without a list of tool names.
- `iteration_runaway` requires 150 tool calls without an intervening user
  message; sub-agents are exempt (`health.rs:220-278`).
- Issue title construction (`tracker.rs:59-90`), `python_repr`, rune truncation,
  truncation with a marker (`util.rs:69-113`), display sanitization
  (`digest.rs:147-155`), and USD formatting (`digest.rs:1120-1127`) have pure
  Go equivalents. A source-specific title exception was dropped.
- `internal/serdejson` reproduces the relevant serde_json 1.x output: sorted
  keys, no HTML escaping, and float layout. The planned event ledger must
  match jilog's format byte for byte, and the planned digest JSON uses the
  same encoder, within the documented parity limits.

## Planned replacements

- Database tables replace the processed-sessions file and retry sidecar. A
  catch-up job will build each completed local day once, replacing the nightly
  run.
- A direct usage-rollup query will replace the `agentsview usage daily`
  shell-out for archive spend.
- A native Kata HTTP client will replace the Kata CLI tracker. Filing remains
  off until a Kata hub is configured.
- Generic NanoClaw persona and channel resolution, trust filtering, and
  message-envelope cleanup will retain the public NanoClaw behavior. They will
  be inactive until a NanoClaw data directory is configured.

## Archive input and patterns

- AgentsView parser and archive rows replace jilog's transcript readers.
  `BuildSessionInput` prepares detector input from those rows.
- Existing retry, runaway-loop, edit-churn, mid-task-compaction, and
  context-pressure signals replace jilog's `stuck_loop` and `compaction_storm`
  as pattern kinds.
- Session parent relationships replace jilog's 16-zero sub-agent ID prefix.

## Dropped

- `resume_storm`, whose only source is Amplifier `session:resume` events.
- The `{"error","success"}` envelope parsing, error-message precedence, the
  `mode` denial rule, and the structured `bash` envelope checks (`returncode`,
  `stdout`, `stderr`). They read Amplifier result fields that the archive does
  not store.
- The GitHub tracker, synthetic IDs from the none tracker, file-path helpers
  (`contract_tilde`, `expand_tilde`), and `run_with_timeout`.
- Collectors and rules tied to a particular worker setup: private diagnostic
  collectors, seats inferred from fixed pool-profile paths, a worker-specific
  title exception, and a P0 exclusion list of worker tool names. A configured
  source can provide generic diagnostics and seats in later PRs.
- Migration or matching of existing `[jilog/…]` issues. Friction Log starts with
  its own issue history.

## Additions

- `frustration` and `interruption` kinds use AgentsView's existing frustration
  markers and interrupted-turn rows. They do not change a jilog kind.
- Archived tool calls supply error and pattern findings. jilog's AgentsView
  reader cannot produce those findings from its session rows.
- Detection and digests are planned to be on by default, as running jilog makes
  them. P0 filing awaits the archive and Kata integration.

## Deliberate differences

- Titles use `[friction/<kind>]`, labels use `friction`, and the planned digest
  heading is `# Friction Log — <date>`.
- Coding corrections require the chat marker patterns too. jilog counts every
  15-200 byte user turn between two assistant turns, so instructions such as
  "now run the tests" became corrections. Instructions that contain "don't" or
  "do not", or start with "no,", still match.
- The adapter removes system, compact-boundary, and tool-result rows from every
  correction stream, extending jilog's NanoClaw rule to all sessions.
- The adapter drops thinking blocks and tool renderings from stored assistant
  content, matching jilog's text-block-only extraction.
- The adapter marks a tool call failed when `signals.IsFailure` reports it,
  passes the result text as the error message, and maps the `Bash` tool
  category to `bash` for the noise rule.

## Session input adapter

agentsview does not port jilog's file readers. `friction.BuildSessionInput` maps
archived rows into the message stream jilog's detectors read:

- System rows, compact-boundary rows and `tool_result` fallback rows are dropped
  from the stream. This applies jilog's NanoClaw rule to every session (D10)
  and closes jilog's Claude Code reader gap, which kept `isMeta` and
  compact-summary lines.
- Assistant text drops inline `[Thinking]` blocks and tool-call renderings,
  reproducing jilog's text-blocks-only extraction (D11).
- Every tool call becomes a `tool` message with a failure flag from
  `signals.IsFailure` and plain result text. Text comes from the last result
  event when its status and content are non-empty, otherwise from the call's
  result content. The noise rule uses `bash` for any Bash-category call.
- Pattern kinds reuse `internal/signals`: `retry_loop`, `runaway_loop`,
  `edit_churn`, `mid_task_compaction` and `context_pressure`.
  `iteration_runaway` is ported. `resume_storm` is dropped because no
  agentsview source records resumes (D14).

Architecture-forced deltas from jilog:

- jilog's `stuck_loop` fires at 4 identical calls. `retry_loop` fires at 3,
  because it is the same predicate as the Quality page's retry count.
- Compaction storms (3 compactions within 10 minutes) are replaced by mid-task
  compactions, the agentsview signal. The evidence range spans all compact
  boundaries in the session.
- A user message that mixes text and tool results keeps its text, because the
  echo part was removed at parse. jilog would skip it.

Additions beyond jilog:

- Frustration markers (`signals.IsFrustrationMarker`) and user interruptions
  (rows the Claude parser tags `interrupted`) are friction kinds of their own.
  They run after jilog's five kinds.
- `SeatFromPath` uses only the patterns its caller provides. Wiring those
  patterns to `[friction] seat_patterns` configuration is planned for a later
  PR. jilog's built-in pool-directory conventions are not carried over.

## Parity notes

- Go's RE2 `\b` is ASCII-only; Rust's word boundary is Unicode-aware. A
  corrective marker beside a non-ASCII letter (`wrongé`) matches here but not
  in jilog. `TestChatCorrectionWordBoundary` pins this accepted difference.
- RE2 `\d` is ASCII-only. A timeout sentence with fullwidth digits is reported
  as an error here and suppressed by jilog. `TestBareTimeoutDigitClass` pins
  the difference.
- serde_json 1.0.149 formats floats with zmij, not ryu. `internal/serdejson`
  ports zmij's layout. serde_json's default parser can be one unit in the last
  place off for some long literals, such as `12345678901234567.0`; Go parses
  them exactly, so those values print differently.
- `friction.ParseUSD` accepts plain decimals only. rust_decimal also accepts
  exponents and underscores, which AgentsView does not produce.
- An empty tool name becomes `unknown`; jilog does this only for a missing name.

## Digest golden deltas

The digest renderer is planned. When it lands, this section will list every
difference between AgentsView's golden digest and jilog's
`tests/golden/learning-digest.md`.

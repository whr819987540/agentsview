## Install

### Desktop App

On macOS, the easiest install is via Homebrew Cask:

```bash
brew install --cask agentsview
```

On Windows and Linux (and as an alternative on macOS), download the latest
`.dmg`, `.exe`, or `.AppImage` from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kenn-io/agentsview/releases). The desktop
app is fully bundled — no CLI or dependencies needed — and includes built-in
auto-update support.

!!! note

    The desktop app and CLI share the same data directory (`~/.agentsview/`), so
    you can use one or both. They are fully complementary, not mutually
    exclusive.

On macOS, closing the desktop window hides it instead of quitting AgentsView.
Use the AgentsView menu-bar status item to show the window again, open the logs
folder, check for updates, or quit the desktop app and its managed backend.
Clicking its Dock icon or selecting it with Cmd-Tab restores the hidden window.

To keep AgentsView out of the Dock and Cmd-Tab while its window is closed, turn
on **Hide from Dock and Cmd-Tab when window closed** in the menu-bar menu. This
option is off by default and stays set across relaunches.

#### macOS: use the bundled CLI

The macOS app includes the `agentsview` CLI at
`/Applications/AgentsView.app/Contents/MacOS/agentsview`. Homebrew Cask links it
into Homebrew's `bin` directory automatically.

If you installed the `.app` from a downloaded `.dmg`, move it to Applications,
then add its CLI to your current shell's `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="/Applications/AgentsView.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH"
```

Add that same `export` line to `~/.zshrc` to keep it in new Terminal windows
(or your shell's startup file if you use a different shell). Adjust the path
if you installed the app elsewhere. The CLI follows updates to the app at that
location; update it through the desktop app or Homebrew.

Before running the bundled CLI for the first time, open AgentsView from
Applications in a graphical login session and complete the macOS first-launch
dialogs. A fresh Homebrew Cask install over SSH has been reported to leave the
CLI hanging without output until this step is completed. Adding it to `PATH`
does not replace that first launch. For an unattended Mac, use the
[standalone CLI installer](#shell-script) instead.

Confirm which CLI your shell finds and check its version:

```bash
command -v agentsview
agentsview --version
```

### pip / uvx

```bash
pip install agentsview    # install permanently
uvx agentsview            # or run without installing
```

Platform-specific wheels are published to PyPI for Linux (x86_64, aarch64),
macOS (x86_64, arm64), and Windows (x86_64, arm64).

### Shell Script

For macOS and Linux, this installs the standalone CLI without the desktop app.
Use this path when setting up a Mac over SSH without a graphical login session.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://agentsview.io/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://agentsview.io/install.ps1 | iex"
```

The installer detects your OS and architecture, downloads the latest release
from GitHub Releases, verifies the SHA-256 checksum, and installs the binary.

On macOS and Linux, it installs to `/usr/local/bin` when that directory is
writable, or `~/.local/bin` otherwise. Follow the installer's `PATH` instructions
and run `command -v agentsview` to check which binary your shell uses. When
the standalone CLI and bundled CLI use different directories, put the
standalone install directory first in `PATH` to select it.

!!! note

    On Windows on ARM, the installer uses the native `arm64` build when one is
    available and otherwise falls back to the `x86_64` build, which runs under
    Windows' built-in x64 emulation. To get a native binary on a release that
    predates arm64 support, [build from source](#build-from-source).

### Build from source

Requires Go 1.27+ with CGO and Node.js 24.11+:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kenn-io/agentsview.git
cd agentsview
make build
make install  # installs to ~/.local/bin
```

!!! note

    CGO is required for the SQLite driver. The `fts5` build tag enables
    full-text search.

#### Windows on ARM

`make` isn't available on Windows, and CGO needs a C compiler that targets
`aarch64`. Install [Go for Windows/ARM64](https://go.dev/dl/),
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and the aarch64
[llvm-mingw](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/releases) toolchain (a
self-contained clang + runtime; no Visual Studio or Windows SDK required), then
build manually in PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/kenn-io/agentsview.git
cd agentsview

# 1. Build the frontend and embed it
cd frontend; npm ci; npm run build; cd ..
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force frontend/dist internal/web/dist

# 2. Compile with the aarch64 toolchain
$env:CGO_ENABLED = "1"
$env:CC = "C:\path\to\llvm-mingw\bin\aarch64-w64-mingw32-clang.exe"
go build -tags fts5 -o agentsview.exe ./cmd/agentsview
```

The resulting `agentsview.exe` is a native ARM64 binary. Most users don't need
this — the installer and PyPI wheels ship native arm64 builds — but it's useful
for development or to run unreleased changes.

### Docker

Multi-arch images for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` are published to GitHub
Container Registry on every tagged release and on pushes to main:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \
  -v agentsview-data:/data \
  -v "$HOME/.claude/projects:/assets/static/agents/claude:ro" \
  -e CLAUDE_PROJECTS_DIR=/assets/static/agents/claude \
  ghcr.io/kenn-io/agentsview:latest
```

The container's entrypoint runs `agentsview serve` by default. Set `PG_SERVE=1`
to switch to `agentsview pg serve` instead — the same image powers both modes.

A containerized AgentsView only sees agent sessions from directories you
explicitly bind-mount into the container. Mount each agent's session root
read-only and point the matching
[directory env var](/docs/configuration/#session-discovery) at it. The data volume
(`/data`) is owned by root inside the container, so prefer a named Docker volume
over a host bind mount, or pre-create the host directory with the desired
ownership.

A production-style Compose example lives in the repo at
[`docker-compose.prod.yaml`](https://github.com/kenn-io/agentsview/blob/main/docker-compose.prod.yaml).
It persists `/data` in a named volume, mounts Claude, Codex, and OpenCode
session roots read-only, and publishes the UI on `127.0.0.1:8080`:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up -d
```

The example publishes the UI on loopback only. To expose it beyond the host,
also enable bearer-token [authentication](/docs/remote-access/#authentication) and
publish the port intentionally.

For a PostgreSQL-backed deployment, point the container at your shared database:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \
  -e PG_SERVE=1 \
  -e AGENTSVIEW_PG_URL='postgres://user:password@host:5432/agentsview?sslmode=require' \
  ghcr.io/kenn-io/agentsview:latest
```

## Run

The desktop app handles startup automatically: it attaches to an existing local
daemon or starts one in the background, then opens the discovered URL. The
daemon is shared with CLI commands and may outlive the desktop window, but it
self-exits after an idle period when no client request or daemon-owned job is
active.

CLI users can start the web UI explicitly:

```bash
agentsview serve
```

Bare `agentsview serve` runs in the foreground until you press `Ctrl+C`. If a
compatible server is already running, it reports that server's URL and exits.

This will:

1. Initialize the SQLite database at `~/.agentsview/sessions.db`
1. Discover and sync sessions from all
   [supported agents](/docs/configuration/#session-discovery)
1. Start watching session directories for changes
1. Launch the web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in your browser. Pass `--no-browser` to disable
automatic browser launch. Alternatively, start the same server in the background
so it can keep running after your shell exits:

```bash
agentsview daemon start
agentsview daemon status
agentsview daemon restart
agentsview daemon stop
```

The daemon includes the web UI, API, session sync, and file watchers. You do not
need to run `serve` after `daemon start`. Stopping it with `daemon stop` or
`serve stop` shuts down the web UI and sync together. `serve stop` also stops
read-only mirror servers for the same data directory.

`daemon start` and `daemon restart` use the normal effective configuration from
`config.toml` and supported environment variables. They do not accept
serve-specific flags. `daemon restart` also starts the daemon when it is
stopped. A restart stays attached and reports startup phases until the
replacement daemon is ready; press `Ctrl+C` to stop waiting without terminating
the child, then inspect it with `agentsview daemon status`.

The existing `agentsview serve --background`, `agentsview serve status`, and
`agentsview serve stop` commands remain available. Use `serve --background` when
a one-off daemon needs a serve-only flag, such as `--no-sync` or an
unauthenticated non-loopback `--host` override. `--no-sync` is runtime-only and
cannot be set in `config.toml`.

You do not need to keep a server running for every CLI command. Read-only
commands attach to the daemon when it is warm, otherwise they read the local
archive directly in read-only mode. Commands that need fresh data or need to
write, including `sync`, `usage`, `token-use`, `pg push`, and `duckdb push`,
auto-start the detached daemon when needed. The server remains running after
these commands finish. For scripts or CI jobs that must leave no background
server, stop the daemon first, then run `AGENTSVIEW_NO_DAEMON=1 agentsview sync`.
That setting disables auto-start; it does not stop a running daemon or bypass
its archive lock.

## Customize

Override the default port or host:

```bash
agentsview serve --port 9090
agentsview serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
agentsview serve --no-browser  # Disable browser auto-open
agentsview serve --background --no-sync  # One-off flag-driven background run
```

!!! tip "Forwarded development environments"

    If you open AgentsView through exe.dev, Codespaces, Coder, WSL2, SSH port
    forwarding, or a reverse proxy, restart the CLI with `--public-url` set to
    the exact browser origin:
    `agentsview serve --public-url https://<vm>.exe.xyz`.

    A dashboard flash followed by a settings or API error usually means the
    server rejected the forwarded host or origin. It is not a missing auth
    token unless `/api/v1/settings` returns `401`. See
    [Remote Access](/docs/remote-access/#forwarded-dev-environments).

Point to custom session directories with environment variables. Aider has no
default discovery root, so set `AIDER_DIR` to opt into scanning Aider logs:

```bash
export AIDER_DIR=~/code
export AMP_DIR=~/custom/amp/threads # historical local Amp threads only
export ANTIGRAVITY_DIR=~/custom/antigravity

For Claude, Codex, and Cursor, custom roots may also be `s3://` URIs:

```toml
[agents.claude]
dirs = ["s3://agent-archive/laptop/raw/claude"]
[agents.codex]
dirs = ["s3://agent-archive/laptop/raw/codex"]
[agents.cursor]
dirs = ["s3://agent-archive/laptop/raw/cursor"]
```

Set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, and optionally
`AWS_S3_ENDPOINT` before starting AgentsView. See
[S3-compatible session sources](/docs/configuration/#s3-compatible-session-sources)
for the expected object layout and sync behavior.

## What You'll See

Once running, the web UI provides:

- **Session list** with filtering by project, agent, date, and message count
- **Message viewer** with full content, tool calls, and thinking blocks
- **Session intelligence** with health grades, outcomes, and signal panels
- **Full-text search** with project and date filters in `Ctrl/Cmd+K`
- **Open session** by full ID or UUID with `Ctrl/Cmd+G`
- **Analytics** including activity heatmaps, tool usage, and velocity charts
- **Activity reporting** with concurrency, agent-minutes, cost, and session rows
- **Session export** to standalone HTML, markdown export links for agent
  handoff, or GitHub Gist

Use the [Usage Guide](/docs/usage/) for navigation and resume controls. To
correct project assignments, see the [Data page](/docs/data/) and its opt-in
project workspace.

Beyond full-text search, opt-in semantic search lets
`agentsview session search --semantic` (or `--hybrid`) match session content by
meaning, backed by a local or hosted embeddings endpoint. See
[Semantic Search](/docs/semantic-search/) for setup.

title: Remote Access
description: Access AgentsView from other devices on your network
---

AgentsView binds to `127.0.0.1` by default, so only your local machine can reach
it. To make the UI available from other devices, you need to do two things:

- listen on a non-loopback address or put the server behind a proxy
- require a bearer token for API access

In current releases, bearer-token auth is controlled by `require_auth`.

## Quick Setup

For a one-off background server, enable auth in `~/.agentsview/config.toml`:

```toml
require_auth = true
```

Then pass a one-off non-loopback bind:

```bash
agentsview serve --background --host 0.0.0.0
```

Omit `--background` when you want that `serve` invocation to stay in the
foreground. The explicit `--host` flag also permits a one-off unauthenticated
non-loopback bind, though authenticated access is strongly recommended.

For a persistent, config-driven node — so restarts and auto-started daemons keep
the server reachable — set both values in `config.toml` instead of passing a
flag each time:

```toml
host = "0.0.0.0"
require_auth = true
```

Then use the canonical writable-daemon lifecycle:

```bash
agentsview daemon start
agentsview daemon status
# After configuration changes:
agentsview daemon restart
```

A non-loopback `host` in `config.toml` requires `require_auth = true`; the
server refuses to start rather than persistently exposing an unauthenticated
API. The `--host` flag remains available for one-off unauthenticated binds.

When the server runs inside WSL, AgentsView advertises the WSL `eth0` address
instead of `127.0.0.1` so the printed URL is usable from the Windows host and
nearby LAN clients. An explicit `--public-url` still takes precedence.

When auth is enabled, AgentsView generates a token if needed and stores it in
`~/.agentsview/config.toml`. Open `http://<your-ip>:8080` from another device
and enter the configured token in the frontend, or send it in an `Authorization`
header.

!!! note

    Older configs may still use `remote_access = true`. AgentsView still reads
    that legacy key, but new setups should use `require_auth = true`.

## Authentication

When `require_auth` is enabled, all `/api/` requests must include:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The token is stored in `config.toml` as `auth_token`. It is generated
automatically the first time auth is enabled, so you do not need to mint one
manually. For supervised services or temporary overrides, set
`AGENTSVIEW_AUTH_TOKEN`; it takes precedence over the config file.

Auth is enforced on API routes, not on static assets. That means a browser can
load the HTML shell, but API requests fail with `401` until the correct token is
supplied.

When `require_auth` is disabled, normal local loopback use remains ungated.

## HTTP Remote Sync

Configured `[[remote_hosts]]` entries can use `transport = "http"` when the
remote machine is already running an AgentsView daemon:

```toml
[[remote_hosts]]
host = "devbox1"
transport = "http"
url = "http://devbox1.tailnet.ts.net:8080"
token = "remote-token"
interval = "5m" # optional: sync periodically while the collector daemon runs
```

Treat `host` as the remote machine's stable, unique identity. AgentsView uses it
to namespace imported session IDs, the database skip cache, and the mirror
directory. Changing it creates a new namespace and can duplicate sessions from
the same machine; reusing it for a different machine can reuse stale cached
state. Changing only `url` is fine when the same logical machine moves.

The daemon on the remote machine must bind a non-loopback interface (set
`host = "0.0.0.0"` with `require_auth = true` in its config.toml) or every sync
fails with a connection-refused error. See
[Remote Hosts](/docs/configuration/#remote-hosts) for the full remote-side setup,
including keeping detached daemons alive.

Use `require_auth = true` on remote nodes when practical, or at minimum keep
their generated `auth_token` configured. The remote archive endpoints always
require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, even when the rest of the daemon API is
unauthenticated. The `token` in the collector's `remote_hosts` entry must match
the remote daemon's `auth_token` and is required for HTTP remote sync. Do not
reuse the collector daemon's own `auth_token` for untrusted remote endpoints.

The HTTP transport is intended for private networking such as Tailscale or an
equivalent restricted overlay. Do not expose raw archive endpoints directly to
the public internet.

HTTP remote sync failures are summarized without echoing remote-controlled URLs
or response bodies. Common summaries point at the specific fix: a rejected token
means the collector's per-host `token` does not match the remote daemon's
`auth_token`; a missing endpoint means the remote host needs a newer AgentsView;
connection refusal usually means the daemon is not running, is still bound to
loopback, or the URL port is wrong; DNS and timeout messages point back to the
configured `url`.

A bare `agentsview sync` treats offline, unreachable, and timed-out configured
HTTP hosts as absent fleet members. It prints a skipped-host progress line,
continues with local and reachable remote sources, and exits successfully unless
another error occurs. `agentsview sync --host X` remains strict and reports an
unavailable explicitly selected host as an error.

For always-available fleet nodes launched with `agentsview daemon start`, set:

```toml
daemon_idle_timeout = "0s"
```

That setting controls detached writable daemons, including config-driven and
`serve --background` launches. Supervised daemons run under systemd, launchd,
Docker, or a foreground shell never create the idle tracker and already stay
alive until their supervisor stops them.

Run `agentsview sync` on the collector to sync local sessions and every
configured host. Set `interval` on a `[[remote_hosts]]` entry when a running
collector daemon should sync that host periodically; omit it or set it to `0s`
for manual sync only. See [`agentsview sync`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-sync) for
single-host selection and failure behavior.

## Incremental Sync

Starting in 0.37.4, HTTP remote sync keeps a persistent mirror of each remote
machine's syncable source files under:

```text
<data_dir>/remote-mirrors/<sanitized-host>-<hash>/
```

For the default data directory, that parent is `~/.agentsview/remote-mirrors/`.
The readable host component is followed by a hash so names that sanitize to the
same directory name do not collide. A lock file next to each mirror serializes
concurrent syncs of that host from the same data directory.

The mirror adds an on-disk copy of the remote session sources to the collector,
in addition to the indexed database. Budget roughly the size of each remote
host's syncable source corpus for it. Incremental transfer applies only to the
HTTP transport. SSH remote sync is deprecated, receives only critical fixes,
and continues to copy a full session tree on each run.

### How A Sync Works

1. The collector asks the remote daemon for its resolved agent roots. The remote
   controls this allowlist; the collector cannot name arbitrary roots.
1. The collector locks the host mirror and requests a gzip-compressed manifest
   of regular, non-symlink files. Each entry carries its absolute remote path,
   size, and modification time.
1. The collector walks the mirror and compares file size and modification time
   at microsecond precision. It schedules missing or changed files for fetch and
   removes mirror files that disappeared from the manifest. Before changing the
   mirror, it durably merges those paths into a bounded recovery journal next to
   the mirror.
1. When fewer than half of the manifest's files need fetching, the collector
   requests only that delta. At half or more, it requests a full archive instead
   of sending a large file list. The current collector advertises gzip support
   for both archive modes.
1. The archive is extracted into the mirror with remote modification times
   preserved. AgentsView classifies the pending journal paths and imports only
   their affected sources. A provider whose exact scope cannot be proven falls
   back to discovery under that provider's roots; it does not widen other
   providers. The journal is retired only after session writes and the remote
   skip cache are durable.

Transfer breadth and import breadth are independent. The half-manifest
heuristic can download a full archive while the collector still processes only
the changed-source plan. Conversely, an explicit full import reparses the
complete mirror without forcing unchanged bytes across the network.

For a configured full sync that includes local sources, mirror preparation
finishes before database work begins. The collector then ingests local sources
and every prepared HTTP mirror through the same batched temporary-database path,
with FTS maintenance suspended during ingest and rebuilt once before an atomic
swap. Configured SSH hosts run afterward. A preparation, parser, batch-write, or
FTS failure leaves the active archive unchanged and prevents the SSH phase.

Remote-only syncs, including
`agentsview sync --host <configured-http-host> --full`, continue to import into
the active archive and do not use the combined rebuild path.

If no directory-scoped files changed, the collector skips the archive request
and, when no recovery work is pending, performs no import. Files that disappear
remotely are deleted from the mirror, but remote import is intentionally
non-destructive: sessions already stored in the AgentsView database remain
available.

If a process stops after mirror mutation, the next sync replays the pending
journal. Cache invalidation is armed once per observed remote version so a
same-mtime extraction cannot be hidden by stale cache state. A deterministic
parse failure is then retained in the existing error-skip cache, retried on
replay as a skip, and re-armed only when the remote path changes again. Recovery
work is bounded; overflow collapses to one conservative full import.

Windsurf is a special case. Its state database is sanitized into a curated
export for every transfer, so the raw tree cannot safely participate in the
manifest. AgentsView fetches that small export as a separate full archive on
each sync while the rest of the host remains eligible for delta transfer. The
Windsurf content in the mirror is the sanitized export, not a byte-for-byte copy
of the remote state database.

### Curated Provider Exports

Most providers export their configured directories as-is. Providers whose
configured root is a broad application-data directory export a curated file
list instead, so caches, extension state, and credential files stored near the
sessions never enter the manifest, the archive, or the mirror:

- **Cursor** exports only the transcript files its parser discovers under each
  project's `agent-transcripts/` directory.
- **VS Code Copilot** exports only chat session files under
  `workspaceStorage/<hash>/chatSessions/` and
  `globalStorage/{emptyWindowChatSessions,transferredChatSessions}/`, plus each
  exporting workspace's `workspace.json` for project attribution.
- **Zed** exports `threads/threads.db` as a consistent SQLite snapshot taken
  with the online backup API, so committed write-ahead-log data arrives as one
  standalone database without `-wal` or `-shm` sidecars. Hermes state databases
  use the same snapshot mechanism.
- **RooCode** and **Kilo Legacy** export only their discovered per-task session
  files, **Poolside** narrows its root to `trajectories/`, and **Windsurf**
  exports the sanitized copy described above.

Budget mirror disk for the curated session files only, not for the full
application-data directories those editors keep around them. When the last
session under a curated Cursor or VS Code Copilot root disappears, the root
stays advertised with an empty file list so the next sync empties the mirror
instead of failing.

An unreadable snapshot database is treated as missing: the sync continues, the
mirror drops its cached copy, and the file transfers again once the remote
application repairs it. Sessions already imported into the AgentsView database
remain available throughout. Any other read failure during target resolution
fails that host's sync without touching the mirror.

### When AgentsView Downloads A Full Archive

A full HTTP transfer occurs in these cases:

- the per-host mirror is new or was removed
- at least half of the manifest files are missing or changed
- a delta request is rejected after a manifest succeeded; the collector retries
  once with a full archive

Windsurf's curated export is also fetched in full on every sync, independently
of the directory-scoped archive decision.

`--full` reparses every discovered remote session but still uses the manifest
comparison to decide which mirror bytes need transferring. It does not delete
the local database or turn remote sync into a destructive reconciliation.

### Compatibility And Recovery

HTTP remote sync requires the collector and remote daemon to use the same
remote-sync protocol version. Every target, manifest, and archive request
carries that version, and successful responses echo it. A missing or mismatched
request version returns HTTP 426 before targets or archive data are exchanged,
so upgrade both hosts before syncing again after either side changes protocol.

The normal mirror comparison detects interrupted extraction when the resulting
file size or modification time differs from the manifest, and the next sync
fetches that file again. It also repairs file-versus-directory conflicts left by
an interrupted extraction.

The comparison does not hash file content. A remote rewrite that preserves both
size and modification time, or local mirror corruption with the same metadata,
can therefore look unchanged. Because `--full` now separates reparsing from
mirror transfer, it does not repair same-stat corruption by itself.

The mirror is a disposable transfer cache. When no sync is running, deleting a
host's mirror directory is the repair procedure: the next compatible sync
bootstraps it again. Leave the adjacent `.lock` file in place. Removing mirror
files never removes imported sessions from the database.

### Transfer Safety

The remote daemon recomputes its allowed sync targets for each request and
rejects paths outside them. Manifest walks omit symlinks and special files;
delta requests must either match an allowed extra file exactly or use an
absolute path in the same POSIX, drive-letter, or UNC dialect as the allowed
root. Symlinked roots or intermediate components are refused. Mirror deletions
and type-conflict cleanup are separately confined to the per-host mirror root.

These checks limit what authenticated sync requests can read, but they do not
replace network isolation or bearer-token security. Keep the daemon on a private
network and protect its `auth_token` as described above.

## SSE Endpoints

The SSE endpoints also accept `?token=<token>` because browser `EventSource`
cannot set custom headers:

```text
http://<host>:8080/api/v1/events?token=<token>
http://<host>:8080/api/v1/sessions/<id>/watch?token=<token>
```

Use header-based auth for normal API calls whenever possible.

## Public URL And Trusted Origins

The bind address, browser URL, and trusted origins serve different purposes:

| Setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--host` / `--port` | Choose the backend HTTP listener (default `127.0.0.1:8080`). |
| `--proxy-bind-host` / `--public-port` | Choose the managed Caddy listener when `--proxy caddy` is enabled. |
| `--public-url` | Choose the browser URL and add it to the trusted origins. Managed Caddy also uses it as its site address. |
| `--public-origin` | Add trusted origins for request `Host` and `Origin` checks without selecting a browser URL. |

For a hostname or reverse proxy you already operate, set the URL you intend to
open in the browser:

```bash
agentsview serve --public-url https://agents.example.com
```

This setting does not configure DNS, port forwarding, certificates, or an
external reverse proxy. The startup message labels it **browser URL**, separately
from the backend's listening address; it does not confirm that the URL is
reachable. Here, "public" means the client-facing address, which may be local
or private.

Opening that URL locally is useful when you want to use the same HTTPS hostname
and proxy route as other clients. Direct backend access uses a different browser
origin, with separate browser storage. On a headless server, use `--no-browser`;
the URL still contributes to origin validation and managed Caddy configuration.

Use a concrete hostname or IP in `--public-url`. Wildcard addresses such as
`0.0.0.0` and `::` select listening interfaces, so they belong in `--host` or
`--proxy-bind-host`, not the browser URL.

For trust-only configuration, use `--public-origin`. It works on its own or
alongside `--public-url`:

```bash
agentsview serve \
  --public-origin https://agents.example.com \
  --public-origin https://internal.example.com
```

Flags can also be comma-separated:

```bash
agentsview serve --public-origin https://a.example.com,https://b.example.com
```

These can also be persisted:

```toml
public_url = "https://agents.example.com"
public_origins = [
  "https://internal.example.com",
]
```

You do not need to repeat `public_url` in `public_origins`. Neither setting
enables bearer-token authentication; that is controlled by `--require-auth`.

### Forwarded Dev Environments

AgentsView validates the request `Host` header before serving API requests. That
protects local loopback servers from DNS-rebinding attacks, but it also means
SSH port forwards, reverse proxies, WSL2, Codespaces, Coder, and similar remote
development environments must use a trusted public URL or origin.

Static assets can still load in these environments because the HTML shell is
intentionally less strict than `/api/` routes. The dashboard may appear briefly,
then `/api/v1/settings` or another API request can fail with `403 Forbidden` if
the browser `Host` is the forwarded hostname rather than one of the local
allowed hosts.

Restart the server with the exact origin you open in the browser:

```bash
# exe.dev browser URL: https://<vm>.exe.xyz
agentsview serve --public-url https://<vm>.exe.xyz

# ssh -L 18080:127.0.0.1:8080 host
# Browser opens http://127.0.0.1:18080
agentsview serve --public-url http://127.0.0.1:18080
```

`--public-url` must match the browser origin exactly, including the scheme,
hostname, and non-default port. When the browser sends an untrusted `Host`,
current releases return `403 Forbidden` with a response body that explains the
rejected host, the allowed set, and the `--public-url` fix. The Settings page
shows the same actionable message instead of prompting for an auth token. A
short breadcrumb is also written to the server debug log.

### Troubleshooting Forwarded Access

If the UI flashes and then the dashboard or settings page fails, check the
`/api/v1/settings` request in browser devtools:

| Symptom or check                              | Meaning                                    | Fix                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/v1/settings` returns `401 Unauthorized` | Bearer-token auth is enabled               | Use the token printed by the server or stored in `~/.agentsview/config.toml` |
| `/api/v1/settings` returns `403 Forbidden`    | The browser host or origin was rejected    | Restart with `agentsview serve --public-url <exact-browser-origin>`          |
| `/api/v1/settings` goes to an unexpected host | The frontend has a saved remote server URL | Clear `localStorage.getItem("agentsview-server-url")` for this site          |

To clear an unintended saved server URL, run this in the browser console and
reload:

```js
localStorage.removeItem("agentsview-server-url")
location.reload()
```

### Slow Aggregates Behind A Proxy

API responses have a write deadline; a request that exceeds it returns `503`
with a `{"error":"request timed out"}` body, and affected dashboard panels show
"request timed out". The default is 30 seconds, which is comfortable for local
archives but can be tight for large shared datasets — heatmap, activity, and
usage summaries scan the full message history.

Raise the deadline with `--write-timeout` (a Go duration). The flag is available
on both the local SQLite server and the PostgreSQL read server:

```bash
# Local SQLite server
agentsview serve --write-timeout 120s

# PostgreSQL-backed read server (the multi-tenant / large-dataset case)
agentsview pg serve --write-timeout 120s
```

Set it to `0` to disable the deadline entirely. If aggregates are slow enough to
need a large timeout, that usually points at a database-side cost worth
investigating first — for a multi-tenant read role, confirm any row-level
security policy is set-based (`session_id IN (SELECT ...)`) rather than a
per-row function call, which the query planner cannot hoist into a single join.

## Managed Caddy Mode

AgentsView can manage a [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) reverse proxy for
TLS-terminated access. The AgentsView backend stays on loopback while Caddy
handles the public socket.

!!! warning "Enable auth first"

    Managed Caddy exposes a public endpoint. Set `require_auth = true` in
    `~/.agentsview/config.toml` before starting the server, or the proxy will
    front an unauthenticated API. See [Quick Setup](#quick-setup).

```bash
agentsview serve \
  --public-url https://agents.example.com \
  --proxy caddy \
  --tls-cert /path/to/cert.pem \
  --tls-key /path/to/key.pem
```

| Flag                | Default     | Description                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `--proxy`           |             | Proxy mode — currently `caddy`                        |
| `--caddy-bin`       | `caddy`     | Path to the Caddy binary                              |
| `--proxy-bind-host` | `127.0.0.1` | Interface for Caddy to bind                           |
| `--public-port`     | URL port or `8443`      | Managed Caddy HTTP/HTTPS listener and URL port                      |
| `--tls-cert`        |             | TLS certificate file path                             |
| `--tls-key`         |             | TLS key file path                                     |
| `--allowed-subnet`  |             | Client CIDR allowlist (repeatable or comma-separated) |

Caddy must already be installed and available on `PATH` unless you override it
with `--caddy-bin`.

### Listener And URL Ports

`--public-port` applies only to managed Caddy. It controls Caddy's listening
port and the port in the resolved `--public-url`; it does not change the backend
`--port`. It works with both HTTP and HTTPS, as selected by the URL scheme.
HTTPS requires `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key`; HTTP must omit them.

- If the URL has an explicit port, Caddy uses that port.
- If the URL omits a port, Caddy uses `--public-port`, or `8443` when the flag is
  unset. Thus `--proxy caddy --public-url https://agents.example.com` resolves to
  `https://agents.example.com:8443`, not port 443.
- If both the URL and `--public-port` specify ports, they must match. For HTTPS
  on port 443, use `--public-port 443` or put `:443` in the URL.

Caddy binds to `127.0.0.1` by default, even when the URL contains a remote
hostname. To accept LAN connections, set `--proxy-bind-host` and an
`--allowed-subnet` as shown below. DNS and routing remain your responsibility.

With an external proxy, leave `--proxy` unset and put its browser-facing port
directly in `--public-url`. `--public-port` has no effect in that mode. For
example, if an existing proxy listens on 443 and forwards to backend port 8080:

```bash
agentsview serve --port 8080 --public-url https://agents.example.com --no-browser
```

### Subnet Allowlists

When using a non-loopback bind host for Caddy, restrict access to specific
networks. Subnet allowlists complement bearer-token auth rather than replacing
it — `require_auth = true` should still be set before binding Caddy off
loopback.

```bash
agentsview serve \
  --proxy caddy \
  --proxy-bind-host 0.0.0.0 \
  --allowed-subnet 192.168.1.0/24 \
  --allowed-subnet 10.0.0.0/8
```

Requests from outside the allowed subnets receive `403`.

## Settings Page

Remote access can also be configured from the Settings page. The **Remote
Access** section lets you:

- toggle `require_auth`
- view the auto-generated auth token
- connect the frontend to another AgentsView server by URL and token

![Settings remote access](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/settings-remote.png)

Changes that affect bind or auth behavior may require a server restart.

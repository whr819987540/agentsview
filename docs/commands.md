## Commands

### `agentsview capture`

Capture and export the usage of one exact non-interactive automation run without
starting the daemon, server, web interface, or watchers:

```bash
agentsview capture run \
  --provider claude \
  --occurrence build-42 \
  --capture-dir ./capture-build-42 \
  --result ./usage-build-42.json \
  -- claude -p "Diagnose the build failure."

agentsview capture report \
  --capture-dir ./capture-build-42 \
  --result ./usage-build-42.json
```

`capture run` supports direct `claude -p` and `codex exec --json` producer
adapters. It leaves child standard input, output, error, and exit outcome
intact. The result always uses a separate file; recovery-only `capture report`
may use `--result -` for standard output. See
[One-shot CI capture](/docs/one-shot-capture/) for the result contract, retry
behavior, failure codes, and a complete GitHub Actions job.

### `agentsview raw-sync`

Capture supported local provider sources and upload their raw generations to
hosted custody:

```bash
export AGENTSVIEW_RAW_SYNC_URL=https://agents.example.com
export AGENTSVIEW_RAW_SYNC_DEVICE_ID=device-id
export AGENTSVIEW_RAW_SYNC_CREDENTIAL=device-credential
agentsview raw-sync watch
agentsview raw-sync status
```

`raw-sync watch` runs an initial bounded audit, watches for filesystem changes,
and retries interrupted uploads from its durable local checkpoint. The device
credential is accepted only through `AGENTSVIEW_RAW_SYNC_CREDENTIAL`, never as a
command-line flag. `--server` and `--device-id` override their corresponding
environment variables.

| Flag                    | Default     | Description                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `--server`              | environment | Raw-sync server URL                        |
| `--device-id`           | environment | Provisioned device ID                      |
| `--allow-insecure-http` | `false`     | Allow HTTP for a loopback server only      |
| `--debounce`            | `2s`        | Coalescing window for filesystem changes   |
| `--interval`            | `15m`       | Interval between bounded provider audits   |
| `--audit-limit`         | `128`       | Maximum source work in each provider audit |

`raw-sync status` reads the checkpoint without creating one and prints path-free
JSON containing capture, queue, retry, failure, and coverage state. S3 roots are
not captured. A deployment operator must provision the device ID and credential;
there is no public enrollment command yet. Accepted raw generations are not yet
parsed into hosted sessions. See [Hosted Raw Sync](/docs/hosted-raw-sync/) for
the current boundary.

### `agentsview daemon`

Manage the writable SQLite server. The daemon provides the web UI, API, session
sync, and file watchers in one process. `daemon start` launches the same server
as `serve --background`, using saved configuration and without opening a
browser. It does not require a separate `serve` command.

```bash
agentsview daemon start
agentsview daemon status
agentsview daemon restart
agentsview daemon stop
```

| Command   | Behavior                                                                |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`   | Start the daemon, or report the existing writable daemon                |
| `status`  | Show writable daemon state, URL, PID, version, and uptime               |
| `restart` | Stop and restart the writable daemon; start it if it is already stopped |
| `stop`    | Stop the writable daemon, or report that it is already stopped          |

`daemon start` and `daemon restart` load the normal effective configuration from
`config.toml` and supported environment variables. They accept no serve-specific
flags: persistent daemon settings belong in configuration. `--no-sync` is
runtime-only and is not a `config.toml` setting. Use
`agentsview serve --background --no-sync` when a one-off detached server must
disable sync. Similarly, use `agentsview serve --background --host <address>`
for a one-off unauthenticated non-loopback bind; a persistent non-loopback
`host` in `config.toml` requires `require_auth = true`.

These commands manage only the writable SQLite daemon for the current data
directory, including a foreground `serve` process or a daemon auto-started by a
CLI command. `daemon stop` stops the web UI and background sync together. They
ignore read-only `agentsview pg serve` and `agentsview duckdb serve` processes.
If only read-only servers are running, `daemon status` reports that no daemon is
running, and `daemon stop` and `daemon restart` leave those servers alive.

Status distinguishes running, starting, and stopped states. `daemon start`
returns after its initial readiness wait if a long migration or sync is still
running; the child continues in the background. `daemon restart` stays attached
and prints phase, detail, and elapsed-time updates until the replacement daemon
is ready. Canceling that wait with `Ctrl+C` leaves the child running. Use
`agentsview daemon status` and inspect the reported `serve.log` when startup is
slow. If startup state remains stuck, follow the error's guidance to verify the
owning process before terminating it manually and retrying.

Startup reports database opening, schema and index updates, and column
migrations before that work begins. These steps appear in the terminal and
`serve.log`, which also records their elapsed times. An upgrade that requires a
full resync is announced as soon as the database version or schema check detects
it. Session counters begin after database preparation finishes.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview serve`

Start the HTTP server with embedded web UI, session sync, and file watchers in
the foreground. It remains attached to the terminal until you press `Ctrl+C`,
unless `--background` is specified. This is the same writable server managed by
`agentsview daemon`; the web UI and sync do not have separate lifecycles.

If a compatible server is already running, `serve` reports its URL and exits.
Open that URL to use the web UI. Stopping the server with either `daemon stop`
or `serve stop` also stops its sync and file watchers. `--no-sync` disables
automatic sync in that process; it does not create a separate sync daemon.

```bash
agentsview serve [flags]
```

As of 0.23.0, starting the server requires the explicit `serve` subcommand.
Running plain `agentsview` shows help instead of starting the web UI.

| Flag                | Default            | Description                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--host`            | `127.0.0.1`        | Host to bind to                                          |
| `--port`            | `8080`             | Explicit nonzero port must be free; `0` selects any      |
| `--no-browser`      | `false`            | Don't open browser on startup                            |
| `--no-sync`         | `false`            | Disable initial, watched, and periodic sync              |
| `--no-update-check` | `false`            | Disable automatic update checks                          |
| `--require-auth`    | `false`            | Require a bearer token for API requests                  |
| `--background`      | `false`            | Start `agentsview serve` as a managed background process |
| `--replace`         | `false`            | Replace a running local daemon before starting           |
| `--public-url`      |                    | Browser URL, also added to trusted origins               |
| `--public-origin`   |                    | Trusted browser origin (repeatable/comma-separated)      |
| `--proxy`           |                    | Managed proxy mode (`caddy`)                             |
| `--caddy-bin`       | `caddy`            | Caddy binary path                                        |
| `--proxy-bind-host` | `127.0.0.1`        | Interface for managed proxy                              |
| `--public-port`     | URL port or `8443` | Managed Caddy HTTP/HTTPS listener and URL port           |
| `--tls-cert`        |                    | TLS certificate path                                     |
| `--tls-key`         |                    | TLS key path                                             |
| `--allowed-subnet`  |                    | Client CIDR allowlist (repeatable/comma-separated)       |

The server auto-discovers an available port if the default `8080` or a port set
in `config.toml` is busy. An explicit nonzero `--port` exits when that port is
occupied. Use `--port 0` to select any available port. For a supervised daemon
that must keep a fixed port, pass `--port` in its launch command.

When replacing a running daemon, an occupied explicit port is rejected before
the daemon stops. The daemon's existing host and port can be reused, including
narrowing a wildcard bind to loopback. To widen a bind on the same explicit
port, stop the daemon first with `agentsview daemon stop`.

`agentsview update` preserves the original `--port` choice recorded by the
running daemon, including `0`. Without an explicit port, restart tries the
previous listening port and retains automatic fallback. See
[Remote Access](/docs/remote-access/) for details on the remote access and proxy
flags.

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview serve                                # defaults
agentsview serve --port 9090                    # custom port
agentsview serve --no-browser                   # disable browser auto-open
agentsview serve --background                   # start managed background server
agentsview serve --replace                      # replace an existing daemon
agentsview serve --public-url https://agents.example.com
```

On startup, the server:

1. Loads or creates `~/.agentsview/sessions.db`
1. Runs initial sync across all discovered session directories
1. Starts the file watcher (500ms event batching; watcher sync starts remain at
    least five seconds apart)
1. Starts periodic sync (every 15 minutes)
1. Serves the Svelte SPA and REST API

The server shuts down cleanly on `Ctrl+C`, flushing the database and stopping
file watchers.

#### Background Mode

The existing `serve` background and lifecycle forms remain available:

```bash
agentsview serve --background
agentsview serve status
agentsview serve restart
agentsview serve stop
```

The parent command starts a detached `agentsview serve` process and waits for it
to publish its runtime record. The five-second readiness window measures startup
inactivity, so continuing startup progress can keep the parent waiting longer.
It then prints the URL, PID, and log path. Background server output is written
to `~/.agentsview/serve.log`. `serve status` reports the preferred managed
process, URL, version, uptime, and read-only mode when available. `serve stop`
retains its broad lifecycle scope: it gracefully terminates confirmed writable
SQLite and read-only PostgreSQL or DuckDB server processes for the data
directory and cleans up their runtime records.

`serve restart` is intentionally narrower and config-driven. It restarts only
the writable SQLite daemon, leaves read-only servers alive, and starts the
writable daemon if it was stopped. It accepts no serve flags and uses the same
effective configuration as `daemon restart`. It is not equivalent to the broader
`serve stop` followed by a foreground `serve` start.

When a writable daemon is already running, a newer release binary automatically
replaces an older compatible daemon before starting. Development builds,
downgrades, and forward API/data-version conflicts do not auto-replace; use
`--replace` when you deliberately want this invocation to stop the running
daemon first. If the SQLite archive itself has a newer data version than the
current binary can open, `serve` refuses before stopping the old daemon.
`serve status` reports incompatible live daemons with their daemon and binary
versions plus `daemon restart` or `daemon stop` guidance.

Background servers also act as the shared local daemon for the desktop app and
CLI. The daemon owns local SQLite writes for its data directory, so common write
and freshness-sensitive commands proxy to it instead of opening the archive as a
second writer. A background daemon self-exits after the idle timeout when no
external request or daemon-owned job is active. Periodic sync and file-watcher
work prevent exit while they run, but do not keep the daemon alive forever by
themselves.

#### CLI daemon behavior

Ordinary session commands, including `session list`, `session get`, and
`session messages`, require a compatible local daemon and start one when needed.
Use `db adopt-machine --list` to inspect historical machine keys or
`doctor sync` for diagnostics. These dedicated commands read the archive without
starting a daemon or changing configuration.

Commands that need fresh data or need to write auto-start the detached daemon
when no compatible daemon is running. That includes local `sync`,
`session sync`, `token-use`, normal `usage` refresh paths,
`pg push`/`pg push --watch`, `duckdb push`, and `clickhouse push`. If a writable
daemon is known to own the archive but is not reachable, these commands refuse
instead of writing directly.

Set `AGENTSVIEW_NO_DAEMON=1` to disable daemon auto-start. Commands that require
the daemon refuse while it is disabled. Direct write commands acquire the local
write-owner lock before opening SQLite. If another process owns that lock, the
command refuses and asks you to stop the daemon, wait for idle shutdown, or
retry after the offline operation finishes.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview sync`

Refresh the local archive. For local sync, the CLI uses the running daemon or
starts a detached daemon so SQLite writes stay owned by one process. That daemon
also serves the web UI and remains running after the CLI exits, until stopped or
its idle timeout expires. The command prints the server URL and how to stop it.

An incremental local-only sync through the default daemon waits when another
sync or maintenance pass owns it, then runs its requested pass. It prints
waiting status; `Ctrl+C` cancels the wait without stopping the existing work.
This waiting message applies when no remote hosts are configured. Full resync,
syncs that include remote hosts, and servers started with `--no-sync` also wait
for exclusive access, but do not show this message. If the wait persists,
inspect `agentsview daemon status` and `serve.log`. A daemon launched for this
local sync skips its redundant startup sync.

For a one-shot offline sync, stop the writable daemon first, then run:

```bash
agentsview daemon stop
AGENTSVIEW_NO_DAEMON=1 agentsview sync
```

The environment variable disables daemon auto-start. It does not stop an
existing daemon or bypass its write-owner lock. The offline command acquires
that lock, syncs directly, and exits without leaving a server running.

```bash
agentsview sync [flags]
```

| Flag       | Default | Description                                          |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `--full`   | `false` | Force a full resync regardless of data version       |
| `--target` |         | Exchange normalized artifacts with a trusted folder  |
| `--host`   |         | Configured HTTP host name or deprecated SSH hostname |
| `--user`   |         | SSH username for deprecated remote sync              |
| `--port`   | `22`    | SSH port for deprecated remote sync                  |

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview sync           # incremental sync and exit
agentsview sync --full    # full resync and exit
agentsview sync --target /path/to/shared-folder
agentsview sync --host buildbox.local
agentsview sync --host buildbox.local --user wes --port 2222
```

After syncing, a summary of session and message counts is printed to stdout.
With `--target`, AgentsView then performs one bounded normalized-artifact
exchange. See [Artifact Folder Sync](/docs/artifact-sync/) for the trust model,
first-use requirements, and exclusions. `--target` cannot be combined with
`--host`.

When `--host` is set, AgentsView syncs only that remote host and fails fast on
error. If the local daemon has a matching configured `[[remote_hosts]]` entry,
the daemon uses that stored entry and its configured transport. Otherwise,
`--host` performs an ad hoc SSH sync: it resolves the supported agent session
directories on the remote machine, transfers the source session data locally,
and indexes it into your local archive. SSH remote sync is deprecated and
receives only critical fixes; use configured HTTP remote sync for new setups.

Local sync can also read configured Claude, Codex, and Cursor roots from
S3-compatible object storage. Add `s3://` entries to `agents.claude.dirs`,
`agents.codex.dirs`, or `agents.cursor.dirs` in `~/.agentsview/config.toml`,
then run `agentsview sync` normally. This is not SSH remote sync: object storage
is treated as a read-only session source, using object size and `LastModified`
metadata to skip unchanged sessions and downloading only objects that need
parsing. See
[Configuration — S3-Compatible Session Sources](/docs/configuration/#s3-compatible-session-sources).

#### Configured Remote Hosts

As of 0.33.0, remote hosts can also be declared in `~/.agentsview/config.toml`
so a single bare `agentsview sync` covers a whole fleet:

```toml
[[remote_hosts]]
host = "buildbox.local"
transport = "ssh" # optional; default
user = "wes"      # optional
port = 2222       # optional, defaults to 22

[[remote_hosts]]
host = "devbox1"
transport = "http"
url = "http://devbox1.tailnet.ts.net:8080"
token = "remote-token"
```

With hosts configured, `agentsview sync` (no `--host`) includes local sources
and configured HTTP hosts in one coordinated sync. During a full or automatic
data-version rebuild, AgentsView prepares every HTTP mirror, bulk-ingests the
local and HTTP sources into one temporary database with FTS updates suspended,
rebuilds FTS once, and atomically swaps the completed archive into place. SSH
hosts run through their existing active-archive path only after that swap.

`--full` reparses every discovered local and remote session, but it does not
force unchanged manifest-capable files to transfer again. Directory-scoped and
verbatim curated content still use delta transfer. Windsurf's sanitized curated
export remains a separate full-archive transfer on every sync. HTTP collectors
and spokes must use the same remote-sync protocol version; incompatible peers
fail before exchanging targets or archive data. A configured HTTP host that is
offline, unreachable, or times out is skipped; reachable HTTP hosts still join
the combined rebuild. Other HTTP preparation or contributor failures abort the
combined rebuild without replacing the active archive or running SSH. Ordinary
incremental and post-swap SSH failures retain per-host reporting, and the
command exits non-zero for any failure other than an unavailable configured HTTP
host. See [Incremental Sync](/docs/remote-access/#incremental-sync).

`agentsview sync --host X` syncs one host, not the whole configured list. When
the local daemon knows a configured host with that identity, it uses the stored
entry and transport so HTTP hosts can be selected by host name. Without a
matching configured host, `--host` remains an ad hoc SSH sync. SSH remote sync
is deprecated and receives only critical fixes. It remains non-interactive in
both forms — it requires key-based passwordless SSH and never prompts for a
password. Prefer configured HTTP remote sync.

HTTP remote sync requires a reachable remote daemon, preferably over a private
network such as Tailscale, and remote archive endpoints always require bearer
auth. The per-host `token` is required and must match the remote daemon's
`auth_token`; do not reuse the collector daemon's own token for untrusted remote
endpoints. Ad hoc HTTP remotes are not supported. Hosts must be unique within
the list, since remote sessions are namespaced by host.

During HTTP remote sync, the collector prints durable phase lines for resolving
remote roots, fetching and comparing the manifest, transferring and extracting
changed files, planning pending paths, processing affected sources, rebuilding
FTS, and swapping the database. Pending paths can outnumber processed sources:
deletions participate in recovery and cache invalidation but usually do not
produce an import source. Provider fallback is identified explicitly, and its
discovered sources determine the processing denominator.

The final per-host line reports changed sessions, ordinary unchanged skips, and
error-suppressed pending entries. A retained-journal line means recovery work
will be replayed; cancellation, processing failure, cache-persistence failure,
retirement failure, and a rebuild awaiting its database swap remain distinct.
Individual source paths are omitted from normal output. Archive downloads also
show live compressed-byte progress when the remote daemon provides a
`Content-Length` header. These phases come from the collector; a spoke upgrade
is needed only for manifest-delta transfer. If an upgraded binary does not show
them, restart the local collector daemon.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview prune`

Delete sessions matching one or more filters. At least one filter is required.

```bash
agentsview prune [flags]
```

| Flag              | Default | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--project`       |         | Sessions whose project contains this substring      |
| `--max-messages`  | `-1`    | Sessions with at most N messages                    |
| `--before`        |         | Sessions that ended before this date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `--first-message` |         | Sessions whose first message starts with this text  |
| `--dry-run`       | `false` | Show what would be pruned without deleting          |
| `--yes`           | `false` | Skip confirmation prompt                            |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Preview what would be deleted
agentsview prune --project "scratch" --dry-run

# Delete short sessions from before 2025
agentsview prune --max-messages 2 --before 2025-01-01

# Delete sessions starting with a specific message
agentsview prune --first-message "test" --yes

# Combine filters (AND logic)
agentsview prune --project "old-project" --max-messages 5 --before 2025-06-01
```

The prune command displays the number of sessions deleted and disk space
reclaimed. Use `--dry-run` first to verify the filter matches what you expect.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview db adopt-machine`

Assign historical local machine keys to this installation. Use this when an
upgrade could not establish which archived sessions are local, or to adopt
additional old hostnames you own. Inspect the archive first, then stop the
daemon:

```bash
agentsview db adopt-machine --list
agentsview daemon stop
agentsview db adopt-machine host-a.example host-b.example
agentsview daemon start
```

Use `--list` alone to print machine keys with session and worktree-rule counts.
It does not start a daemon, write configuration, or adopt sessions.

Select only keys whose sessions belong to this installation. The command moves
their sessions, worktree rules, and project and source metadata to the current
installation ID. Session IDs, messages, stars, pins, and other curation stay
intact. Old named keys remain aliases for filters and URLs. Conflicting worktree
rules stop the command so you can reconcile them before retrying.

Keys that belong to other installations need no action. Legacy `local` rows
always belong to this archive and are assigned to its installation ID at
startup.

The command records ownership in the archive; changing `local_machine_name` only
changes a display label. See
[Upgrading Historical Machine Keys](/docs/configuration/#upgrading-historical-machine-keys)
for automatic adoption and mirror updates.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview db compact`

Reclaim unused space in the local SQLite archive. The command writes and checks
a compacted database before replacing the original, and truncates the
write-ahead log (WAL). It preserves stored sessions and does not change what
future imports retain.

```bash
agentsview db compact [flags]
```

| Flag            | Default | Description                                      |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `--staging-dir` |         | Filesystem location for the staged database      |
| `--dry-run`     | `false` | Report the estimate without changing the archive |
| `--keep-backup` | `false` | Keep the original database backup                |
| `--yes`         | `false` | Skip the confirmation prompt                     |
| `--format`      | `human` | Use `json` for machine-readable output           |

JSON mode writes only the final result to stdout and requires `--yes`; prompts
and human progress messages are written to stderr. When a writable daemon owns
the archive, `--staging-dir` is not accepted because the daemon chooses its own
staging location and the compact endpoint is restricted to localhost. The
command probes for an existing daemon and never starts one: maintenance must not
trigger a daemon's startup sync. When no daemon owns the archive, the command
takes the direct write lock and compacts in process.

On a shared filesystem, peak additional space includes the original backup, the
compacted candidate, a second candidate copy beside the live database, and a
safety margin. With separate filesystems, staging needs the backup plus one
candidate and the database filesystem needs the installation copy. The live
source remains present until the final rename and is never credited as free
space. For a large archive, use a separate volume with enough capacity:

```bash
agentsview db compact --dry-run
agentsview daemon stop  # required for --staging-dir
agentsview db compact \
  --staging-dir /mnt/cache/data-cache/agentsview-compact \
  --keep-backup --yes
agentsview daemon start
```

When a writable daemon is running, the command sends the request to that daemon.
Direct file access is refused while another daemon owns the archive. Reads
continue during the staged build, while writes are refused with a retryable
archive-maintenance error until the verified replacement is committed;
connections pause only for the final swap. Compactions are serialized per
archive: a compaction requested while a sync, resync, or another compaction is
running fails immediately with a conflict instead of queueing.

If a compaction is interrupted or fails partway, the archive stays safe: a
recovery manifest (`compact-recovery.json` beside the database) records the
operation, and the next writable start finishes or rolls back the replacement
before the archive opens. Until then the daemon may keep refusing writes and the
error names the manifest; restarting the daemon resolves it. Once a compaction
has committed, recovery only cleans up leftover staging files and never replaces
the archive, so sessions ingested after a compaction are never at risk. Do not
delete the manifest or the database files by hand.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview db strip --images`

Replace supported inline images and offloaded image references in stored tool
results with text descriptions. The command requires `--images` and asks for
confirmation. It never changes provider source files or standalone image files.
Run `db compact` separately when you need measured SQLite file-space
reclamation. Changed sessions are automatically rescanned for secrets so
detections reflect the remaining content.

Preview with `--dry-run`. Before applying changes, run `agentsview daemon stop`.
The CLI writes directly to the archive and refuses while a writable daemon owns
it. It does not start a daemon. Restart the daemon after the command finishes.

```bash
agentsview db strip --images [flags]
```

| Flag        | Default | Description                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--images`  | `false` | Required image cleanup operation                                                                                     |
| `--project` |         | Sessions whose project contains this substring                                                                       |
| `--before`  |         | Before this date (`YYYY-MM-DD`), using end time, then start time, then creation time when earlier fields are missing |
| `--dry-run` | `false` | Preview selected sessions and byte counts                                                                            |
| `--yes`     | `false` | Skip confirmation                                                                                                    |
| `--format`  | `human` | Use `json` for machine-readable output                                                                               |

JSON apply requires `--yes`. Preview and a declined confirmation leave the
archive unchanged. Reported stored-content bytes and decoded image bytes are
content measurements, not reclaimed disk space.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview db migrate --images`

Move retained inline tool-result image payloads from currently stored archive
rows into the asset store at `{dataDir}/assets`. Each payload is written as a
content-addressed file named `<sha256hex><ext>`. Before the row changes, an
existing object must have the expected byte count and SHA-256 digest. A missing
or corrupt object is replaced while the source bytes remain available. The
inline `input_image` block is replaced with an `agentsview_image` placeholder
whose `image_ref` field holds the `asset://` reference. The
`GET /api/v1/assets/{filename}` route and `renderMarkdown` resolve these
references from the local assets directory.

The image appears in formatted tool output alongside text and other supported
inline or offloaded images. Raw mode shows the stored text, including the
markdown reference, as it always has, and so does a result that still holds an
unmigrated image block, such as an SVG or an `image/bmp` payload beside a
migrated PNG. Under `require_auth` the asset route rejects the browser's image
request, because an `img` element sends no `Authorization` header. Chat-imported
images already carry that limit.

Migration updates images already in the archive. Set
`tool_result_images = "offload"` and restart the daemon to store future
supported images in the same asset directory. With `keep`, a later reparse or
full resync can restore inline images from provider source files. With `drop`,
ingestion and full resync replace images with text descriptions.
`db strip --images` also removes offloaded references from selected results.
Neither operation deletes asset files. The migration command requires `--images`
and never changes provider source files. A separate serving host needs the
matching `{dataDir}/assets` directory as well as the copied database content.
Run `db compact` separately to measure SQLite file-space reclamation after
migration. Back up the `{dataDir}/assets` directory together with the archive.

The raw `agentsview session export` command still streams provider source bytes.
See [image storage](/docs/data/#ingest-time-image-offload) for export and
remote-backend limits.

If a session transaction fails after writing assets, its rows remain unchanged
but complete, unreferenced asset files remain on disk. Retrying the migration
reuses matching files; there is no automatic cleanup of unreferenced assets.
Both `db migrate --images` and `db strip --images` report the sessions that
committed before a later failure.

JPEG assets now use `.jpg` filenames, including `.jpeg` files copied from chat
imports. Existing `asset://<hash>.jpeg` references still resolve, but
re-importing an export with those files can create a second copy under `.jpg`.

Only the four passive image media types are migrated: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`,
`image/webp`, `image/gif`. Every other payload stays inline, including SVG,
which the serving route refuses as active content, and near-misses such as the
non-canonical `image/jpg` spelling. `db strip --images` is broader and replaces
any `image/*` payload with a placeholder, so the two commands do not select the
same rows.

Preview with `--dry-run`. Before applying changes, run `agentsview daemon stop`.
The CLI writes directly to the archive and refuses while a writable daemon owns
it. It does not start a daemon. Restart the daemon after the command finishes.

```bash
agentsview db migrate --images --dry-run
agentsview daemon stop
agentsview db migrate --images
agentsview daemon start
```

| Flag        | Default | Description                                                                                                          |

JSON apply requires `--yes`. Preview and a declined confirmation leave the
archive and assets directory unchanged. Reported stored-content bytes and
decoded image bytes are content measurements, not reclaimed disk space.

### `agentsview version`

Print the version, git commit, and build date. Use `--json` for a stable,
machine-readable response that does not require a running daemon, configuration,
or database.

```bash
agentsview version
agentsview version --json
agentsview version --format json
```

```
agentsview v0.38.0 (commit 5b42bf1c, built 2026-07-13T15:37:17Z)
```

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "name": "agentsview",
  "version": "v0.38.0",
  "commit": "5b42bf1c",
  "build_date": "2026-07-13T15:37:17Z"
}
```

The JSON contract uses these fields:

| Field            | Type    | Meaning                                      |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `schema_version` | integer | Version of this JSON contract; currently `1` |
| `name`           | string  | Canonical tool name, always `agentsview`     |
| `version`        | string  | Build version                                |
| `commit`         | string  | Source commit recorded at build time         |
| `build_date`     | string  | UTC build timestamp, or an empty string      |

Consumers should require the expected `schema_version` and ignore unknown
fields. Adding an optional field does not require a schema bump; removing or
renaming a field, changing a field's type or meaning, or making a previously
valid response invalid does.

### `agentsview usage daily`

Report token usage and estimated cost aggregated by local-time day, scoped to
the last 30 days by default. See [Token Usage & Costs](/docs/token-usage/) for a
full write-up on reporting behavior and agent coverage.

The report reads committed archive data. If it starts the daemon, session sync
runs in the background; run `agentsview sync` first when new source changes must
be included. An older archive that requires reparsing is upgraded before the
daemon starts serving, with startup progress shown in the terminal. A cold usage
cache prepares the sessions needed for the report without waiting for the full
archive backfill. Slow reports print the current preparation phase and elapsed
time to stderr, including with `--json`. Usage preparation is not subject to the
server's normal write timeout. Press Ctrl+C to stop waiting; shared cache work
can continue in the daemon.

Restart older daemons after upgrading so they provide the usage progress
endpoint. `session usage`, `token-use`, and `usage statusline` still wait for
initial sync, including when they reuse a daemon started by daily usage.
Statusline limits the complete wait and report request to 30 seconds.

Offline reads require an archive at the current data version. If an upgrade
requires a resync, run `agentsview daemon restart` and let the resync finish
before retrying the offline command.

```bash
agentsview usage daily [flags]
```

| Flag          | Default       | Description                                                              |

```

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview usage statusline`

Print today's total estimated cost as a single line, for shell prompts and tmux
status lines.

```bash
agentsview usage statusline [flags]
```

| Flag        | Default | Description                                      |

$9.61 today
```

```bash
$ agentsview usage statusline --json
{
  "date": "2026-08-04",
  "cost": {
    "microdollars": 9610000
  }
}
```

See [Token Usage & Costs](/docs/token-usage/#agentsview-usage-statusline) for
integration examples (Starship, tmux).

### `agentsview usage cursor`

Fetch Cursor Admin API usage events and store them in the local archive so they
contribute to the Usage dashboard and daily reports.

```bash
agentsview usage cursor [flags]
```

| Flag          | Default       | Description                          |

agentsview usage cursor
agentsview usage cursor --since 2026-05-01 --until 2026-05-31
agentsview usage cursor --all --email you@example.com
```

See [Cursor Admin Usage Events](/docs/token-usage/#cursor-admin-usage-events)
for setup and reporting behavior.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview activity report`

Report active time, concurrency, cost, token, breakdown, and session rows for a
resolved date range. The command uses the same report model as the web UI's
[Activity](/docs/activity/) page.

```bash
agentsview activity report [flags]
```

| Flag         | Default   | Description                                           |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `--preset`   |           | Range preset: `day`, `week`, `month`, or `custom`     |
| `--date`     | today     | Anchor date for day/week/month presets (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `--from`     |           | Start instant for custom range (RFC3339)              |
| `--to`       |           | End instant for custom range (RFC3339)                |

  --to 2026-06-20T18:00:00Z \
  --bucket 15m
```

The human output prints totals, peak concurrency, top project/model/ agent
breakdowns, and top sessions. JSON output includes the dense bucket timeline and
session rows used by the web UI.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview token-use`

!!! note "Deprecated"

    As of 0.30.0, `agentsview token-use` is a deprecated alias for
    [`agentsview session usage`](/docs/session-api/#agentsview-session-usage). Both
    commands accept the same `<session-id>` argument. `token-use` always emits the
    same JSON shape that `session usage --format json` emits (now extended with a
    cost estimate). New scripts should use `agentsview session usage`.

Print machine-readable token usage data and a cost estimate for a single
session.

```bash
agentsview token-use <session-id>
```

Session ID format depends on the agent. For example, Claude root sessions
usually use UUIDs like `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`, Claude subagents
use IDs like `agent-a86574e`, and some other agents use prefixes such as
`codex:my-session-id`. Raw session IDs emitted by the underlying agent are also
accepted when AgentsView can resolve them back to the canonical stored session.

If the AgentsView server is already running, the command reads the current
database state. If no server is running, it performs an on-demand sync for the
requested session first.

As of 0.40.0, the reported totals include every subagent transcript the session
spawned, so the cost matches what the session actually spent. `token-use` has no
opt-out; use `agentsview session usage <id> --own-only` for own-session numbers.

**Example:**

```bash
agentsview token-use 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

```json
{
  "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "agent": "claude",
  "project": "my-project",
  "total_output_tokens": 15230,
  "peak_context_tokens": 84000,
  "has_token_data": true,
  "cost": {"microdollars": 2410000},
  "has_cost": true,
  "cost_usd": 2.41,
  "models": ["claude-opus-4-7"],
  "server_running": false
}
```

`cost_usd` is a deprecated compatibility alias for `cost.microdollars / 1e6` and
will be removed in a future release; new consumers should read
`cost.microdollars` directly.

See [`agentsview session usage`](/docs/session-api/#agentsview-session-usage)
for the full field reference and exit-code contract.

### `agentsview pg push`

Sync sessions from local SQLite to PostgreSQL. See
[PostgreSQL Sync](/docs/pg-sync/) for full documentation.

```bash
agentsview pg push [target] [flags]
```

| Flag                 | Default | Description                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--full`             | `false` | Force full local resync and re-push                            |
| `--no-vectors`       | `false` | Skip the semantic-search vector phase for this run             |
| `--projects`         |         | Comma-separated projects to push (inclusive)                   |
| `--exclude-projects` |         | Comma-separated projects to exclude from push                  |
| `--all-projects`     | `false` | Ignore configured project filters for this run                 |
| `--all`              | `false` | Push every configured PostgreSQL target sequentially           |
| `--watch`            | `false` | Run continuously, pushing on change plus a periodic floor      |
| `--debounce`         | `30s`   | Coalesce window after a change before pushing (`--watch` only) |
| `--interval`         | `15m`   | Periodic floor push interval (`--watch` only)                  |

See [PostgreSQL Sync — Project Filtering](/docs/pg-sync/#project-filtering) for
details on how filtering interacts with the push watermark.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview pg status`

Show PostgreSQL sync status.

```bash
agentsview pg status [target] [flags]
```

| Flag                 | Default | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--all`              | `false` | Show status for every configured PostgreSQL target          |
| `--projects`         |         | Comma-separated projects whose push status to show          |
| `--exclude-projects` |         | Comma-separated excluded projects whose push status to show |
| `--all-projects`     | `false` | Ignore configured project filters for this status           |

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview pg serve`

Start a read-only session web UI backed by PostgreSQL. On a writable PostgreSQL
schema, the same server also registers the
[hosted raw-sync control plane](/docs/hosted-raw-sync/#http-control-plane). See
[PostgreSQL Sync](/docs/pg-sync/) for full server documentation.

```bash
agentsview pg serve [flags]
```

Accepts the same serve flags (`--host`, `--port`, `--proxy`, etc.) plus
PostgreSQL configuration from `config.toml`. When the host's `[vector]` config
matches a generation pushed to PostgreSQL, semantic and hybrid search are served
from pgvector — see
[Semantic Search — PostgreSQL](/docs/semantic-search/#postgresql).

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview pg service`

Install and manage the PostgreSQL auto-push service, which runs
`agentsview pg push --watch` in the background. Supported service managers are
launchd on macOS and `systemd --user` on Linux. See
[PostgreSQL Sync — `agentsview pg service`](/docs/pg-sync/#agentsview-pg-service)
for setup notes.

```bash
agentsview pg service install
agentsview pg service status
agentsview pg service logs [-f]
agentsview pg service start
agentsview pg service stop
agentsview pg service uninstall
```

| Command     | Description                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `install`   | Generate the service unit, enable it, and start it        |
| `status`    | Show the service-manager status plus last successful push |
| `logs -f`   | Follow `pg-watch.log` under the AgentsView data directory |
| `start`     | Start the installed service                               |
| `stop`      | Stop the installed service                                |
| `uninstall` | Stop and remove the service unit                          |

### `agentsview pg vectors`

Inspect and drop semantic-search embedding generations stored in PostgreSQL. See
[Semantic Search — Maintenance](/docs/semantic-search/#maintenance) for details.

```bash
agentsview pg vectors list [flags]
agentsview pg vectors drop <id> [flags]
```

| Command     | Description                                                                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list`      | List generations with model, dimension, document/chunk counts, and contributing machines |
| `drop <id>` | Drop a generation and all of its embeddings (prompts for confirmation)                   |

| Flag       | Default | Description                                             |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--target` |         | PG target name (default: the default configured target) |
| `--yes`    | `false` | Skip the confirmation prompt (`drop` only)              |

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview duckdb`

Mirror the local SQLite archive into DuckDB and serve from it, locally or over
the Quack remote protocol. See [DuckDB Mirror](/docs/duckdb/) for full
documentation.

```bash
agentsview duckdb push          # mirror SQLite into sessions.duckdb
agentsview duckdb status        # show mirror sync status
agentsview duckdb serve         # read-only web UI from the mirror
agentsview duckdb quack serve   # expose the mirror over Quack
```

`duckdb push` accepts the same `--full` / `--projects` / `--exclude-projects` /
`--all-projects` / `--watch` / `--debounce` / `--interval` flags as `pg push`.
`duckdb push` always writes the local mirror file at `[duckdb].path`; it never
targets a remote Quack endpoint. If `[duckdb].url` or `AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_URL` is
configured, push fails immediately with an error to unset it and serve the
mirror remotely with `duckdb quack serve` instead. `duckdb status` and
`duckdb serve` do target the remote Quack endpoint when `[duckdb].url` or
`AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_URL` is set, and the local mirror file otherwise. When
`[duckdb].path` or `AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_PATH` is set, `duckdb quack serve` exposes
that same mirror by default unless `--path` overrides it. `duckdb serve` accepts
the same serve flags as `pg serve`. The DuckDB backend is unavailable on Windows
ARM64 (the upstream bindings ship no prebuilt library for that platform); all
other commands work normally there.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview clickhouse`

Push the local SQLite archive into ClickHouse and serve the read-only web UI
from it. See [ClickHouse Sync](/docs/clickhouse-sync/) for full documentation.

```bash
agentsview clickhouse push [target] [flags]
agentsview clickhouse status [target] [flags]
agentsview clickhouse serve [flags]
agentsview clickhouse service install
```

`clickhouse push` accepts the same `--full` / `--projects` /
`--exclude-projects` / `--all-projects` / `--all` / `--watch` / `--debounce` /
`--interval` flags as `pg push`, except there is no `--no-vectors` flag.
ClickHouse has no vector phase. `--all --watch` is rejected.

`clickhouse serve` accepts the same serve flags as `pg serve`.
`clickhouse service` installs `clickhouse push --watch` as a launchd or systemd
user unit and writes `clickhouse-watch.log`.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview projects`

List all projects in the local database with their session counts.

```bash
agentsview projects [flags]
```

| Flag       | Default | Description                      |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| `--format` | `human` | Output format: `human` or `json` |
| `--json`   | `false` | Alias for `--format json`        |

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview projects         # tabular output
agentsview projects --json   # JSON array
```

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview health`

Inspect session intelligence in a human-friendly CLI view. See
[Session Intelligence](/docs/session-intelligence/) for the scoring and signal
model.

```bash
agentsview health [session-id] [flags]
```

| Flag       | Default | Description                                            |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--format` | `human` | Output format: `human` or `json`                       |
| `--json`   | `false` | Alias for `--format json`                              |
| `--limit`  | `20`    | Number of sessions to list when no session ID is given |

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview health
agentsview health --limit 50
agentsview health 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
agentsview health agent-a86574e --json
```

Without a session ID, the command lists recent sessions with grade and outcome
columns. With a session ID, it prints the detailed signal counts for that
session.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview stats`

Experimental window-scoped workspace analytics across sessions and git activity.
See [Stats](/docs/stats/) for the full write-up.

```bash
agentsview stats [flags]
```

| Flag                | Default | Description                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--format`          | `human` | Output format: `human` or `json`                                      |
| `--json`            | `false` | Alias for `--format json`                                             |
| `--since`           | `28d`   | Start of window, either `YYYY-MM-DD` or a compact duration like `28d` |
| `--until`           |         | End of window as `YYYY-MM-DD`                                         |
| `--agent`           | `all`   | Restrict to one agent or use `all`                                    |
| `--include-project` |         | Repeatable project allowlist                                          |
| `--exclude-project` |         | Repeatable project blocklist                                          |
| `--timezone`        | local   | Timezone used for temporal reporting                                  |

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview stats
agentsview stats --format json --since 2026-04-01 --until 2026-04-15
agentsview stats --agent claude --include-project agentsview
```

The command is experimental. The exact human output may change, and the JSON
output should be treated as a moving surface even though it currently carries
`schema_version: 1`.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview doctor sync`

Collect read-only diagnostics for startup sync decisions. This command does not
create or migrate config files; it loads the current config read-only, inspects
the SQLite archive, checks configured agent roots, and prints recent
sync-related `debug.log` lines.

```bash
agentsview doctor sync
```

The report includes:

- data directory and SQLite database path
- whether the database exists and is readable
- SQLite `user_version` and the binary data version
- the startup sync decision
- session counts by stored data version
- leftover resync temp files
- configured/default agent roots and whether each exists
- recent debug lines mentioning sync, data versions, warnings, or failures
- Antigravity CLI summary-mode counts and Antigravity sessions decoded from
    unrecognized `agy-schema:` fingerprints
- a likely-cause summary when startup sync behavior looks abnormal

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview parse-diff`

Validate parser changes against the real session archive already in your local
SQLite database. The command re-parses source files with the current binary,
normalizes them through the sync path, and reports field-level differences from
the stored rows without writing updated session data.

```bash
agentsview parse-diff [flags]
```

| Flag               | Default | Description                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--agent`          |         | Restrict to one agent; repeatable                                       |
| `--limit`          | `0`     | Maximum number of source files to inspect, newest first (`0` means all) |
| `--fail-on-change` | `false` | Exit non-zero when changes or parse errors are found                    |
| `--format`         | `human` | Output format: `human` or `json`                                        |
| `--json`           | `false` | Alias for `--format json`                                               |
| `--verbose` / `-v` | `false` | Include more detail in the human report                                 |

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview parse-diff --agent claude --limit 100
agentsview parse-diff --agent codex --fail-on-change
agentsview parse-diff --json > parser-report.json
```

`parse-diff` is intended for parser development and release QA. Run it against a
quiescent, freshly synced archive for the clearest signal. Import-only sources
are skipped because there is no source file to re-parse. Provider-backed stores
with authoritative local sources, including Warp, Forge, Piebald, and Devin, are
covered alongside normal file-backed agents.

The report distinguishes parser drift from comparison-basis skew:

- `raced` means the source changed while `parse-diff` was running. It is
    reported for review but does not fail `--fail-on-change`.
- `incremental_skew` means the stored row was last written by an
    incremental-append sync, so a fresh full re-parse can legitimately differ on
    append-path metadata. It is also reported but excluded from
    `--fail-on-change`.
- `pending_resync` means the stored data version is behind the running binary;
    the next data-version resync rewrites those rows.

If the report includes `incremental_skew`, run a full resync before treating the
archive as a clean parser-drift baseline. A full resync rewrites those rows
through the normalization path and restores strict `parse-diff` scrutiny.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview import`

Import Claude.ai, ChatGPT, or Gemini Apps conversations into the local database.
See [Chat Import](/docs/chat-import/) for full documentation.

```bash
agentsview import --type <type> <path>
```

| Flag     | Default | Description                                                      |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--type` |         | Import type: `claude-ai`, `chatgpt`, or `gemini-apps` (required) |

The path can be a `.zip` file, a `conversations.json` file (Claude.ai only), a
Gemini Apps `MyActivity.html` file, or a directory containing the extracted
export.

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview import --type claude-ai ~/Downloads/claude.zip
agentsview import --type chatgpt ~/Downloads/chatgpt.zip
agentsview import --type claude-ai ./conversations.json
agentsview import --type gemini-apps ~/Downloads/takeout.zip
```

### `agentsview export sessions`

Export content-free session summaries from the local archive. See
[Session Export](/docs/session-export/) for the full JSON/NDJSON contract,
cursor semantics, pricing provenance, and project identity rules.

```bash
agentsview export sessions [flags]
```

| Flag                  | Default | Description                                               |
| --------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--format`            | `json`  | Output format: `json` or `ndjson`                         |
| `--limit`             | `500`   | Maximum sessions to return; max `db.MaxSessionLimit`      |
| `--cursor`            |         | Opaque cursor from a previous response                    |
| `--all`               | `false` | Export every eligible page as one output stream           |
| `--project`           |         | Filter by exact project name                              |
| `--exclude-project`   |         | Exclude sessions from the given project                   |
| `--machine`           |         | Filter by machine name                                    |
| `--git-branch`        |         | Filter by project/branch token                            |
| `--agent`             |         | Filter by agent name                                      |
| `--date`              |         | Include sessions active on `YYYY-MM-DD`                   |
| `--date-from`         |         | Include sessions active on or after `YYYY-MM-DD`          |
| `--date-to`           |         | Include sessions active on or before `YYYY-MM-DD`         |
| `--active-since`      |         | Include sessions active since an RFC3339 timestamp        |
| `--min-messages`      | `0`     | Minimum total message count                               |
| `--max-messages`      | `0`     | Maximum total message count                               |
| `--min-user-messages` | `0`     | Minimum user message count                                |
| `--include-one-shot`  | `false` | Include one-shot sessions, which are excluded by default  |
| `--include-automated` | `false` | Include automated sessions, which are excluded by default |
| `--include-children`  | `false` | Include subagent/child sessions                           |
| `--outcome`           |         | Comma-separated outcome filter                            |
| `--health-grade`      |         | Comma-separated health grade filter                       |
| `--min-tool-failures` |         | Minimum tool-failure signal count                         |
| `--has-secret`        | `false` | Only sessions with detected secret leaks                  |

By default, one-shot and automated sessions are excluded, so token and cost
totals can be lower than the full archive unless the corresponding include flags
are used.

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview export sessions --format json
agentsview export sessions --format ndjson --limit 100
agentsview export sessions --all --format ndjson --project agentsview
```

The JSON top level has `schema_version`, `archive_id`, `database_id`, `cursor`,
`pricing`, `projects`, and `sessions`. NDJSON writes the same metadata as the
first line, then one session row per following line. Current builds emit
`schema_version: 6`; see [Session Export](/docs/session-export/#versioning) for
the v1 and transitional 0.38 release history. The default and maximum page size
is `db.MaxSessionLimit`, currently 500.

For performance diagnosis, `export sessions`, `export hour`, `export day`, and
`export digest` accept `--cpuprofile <file>`, `--memprofile <file>`, and
`--trace <file>`. These write profiling data to files and keep the export on
stdout.

When `--cursor` is present, only `--format`, `--json`, `--limit`, and the
profiling flags may be combined with it. Cursor reset errors write structured
JSON to stderr, leave stdout empty, and exit with code 4:

```json
{"error":"cursor_reset","message":"session export cursor is no longer valid; restart the export","database_id":"..."}
```

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview export conversations`

List conversation changes without message text, then fetch selected visible
user/assistant messages in bounded chunks. See
[Conversation Export](/docs/conversation-export/) for identity, content,
checkpoint and coverage rules.

```bash
agentsview export conversations changes
agentsview export conversations changes --checkpoint SAVED_CHECKPOINT
agentsview export conversations message SESSION_ID MESSAGE_ID \
  --database-id DATABASE_ID --revision REVISION
```

These commands read the local archive and do not send content to another system.
Existing session summary and activity exports remain content-free.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview export hour|day|digest|range`

Export hourly activity and usage, complete days, or digests that identify
changed hours from the local SQLite archive. A digest is a checksum of the
exported content. See [Reporting Export](/docs/reporting-export/) for the JSON
fields, version rules, and correction workflow.

```bash
agentsview export range
agentsview export hour 2026-07-28-13
agentsview export day 2026-07-28
agentsview export day --schema-version 4 --bucket 1m 2026-07-28
agentsview export digest --from 2026-06-28 --to 2026-07-27
```

Hour and date keys must be exact, zero-padded UTC values. Open and future hours
are rejected. The current UTC date contains only closed hours and has no day
digest. Digest ranges include both dates and are limited to 31 days.

Version 3 is the default. Use `--schema-version 4` to group activity and usage
by project, agent, model, and activity category together. Version 4 also accepts
repeatable `--project-key` filters and a `--bucket` duration, such as `1m`,
`5m`, or `15m`. The duration must be a positive whole-minute divisor of one
hour. Version 3 rejects both options. Versions 1 and 2 are no longer available.
Validate your chosen `schema_version` and content digest before accepting a
document. Refresh saved digests when changing versions.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview session`

Programmatic access to session data for scripts, automation agents, and CI jobs.
See [Session API](/docs/session-api/) for full documentation, including
stability guarantees, transport auto-detection, and every subcommand.

```bash
agentsview session get <id>              # metadata + signals
agentsview session list [flags]          # filtered list
agentsview session list --resume         # recently-active resume table
agentsview session messages <id>         # paginated messages
agentsview session tool-calls <id>       # flat tool-call list
agentsview session export <id>           # stream raw source file
agentsview session sync <path-or-id>     # parse + insert
agentsview session watch <id>            # NDJSON event stream
agentsview session search <pattern>      # content search across sessions
agentsview session usage <id>            # token usage and cost estimate
agentsview session usage <id> --own-only # exclude subagent transcripts
```

`session usage` attributes each subagent transcript's spend to the session that
spawned it, so a parent that delegated most of its work still reports the full
cost. `--own-only` restores the older own-session output.

`session search` supports substring (default), `--regex`, `--fts`, `--semantic`,
and `--hybrid` modes. Repeatable `--exclude-session <id>` drops matches from
those sessions before `--limit`. Semantic and hybrid results can be scoped with
`--scope top|all|subordinate` (default `all`) to include or exclude sidechain
and subagent content — see
[Semantic Search](/docs/semantic-search/#scoping-results-scope). The
human-readable table includes an `AGE` column derived from each match's
timestamp, so recent evidence is visible without opening the session. Matches
without a usable timestamp show `—`.

Structured response commands accept `--format json`; `--json` is a short alias
for that scripting mode. `session export` and `session watch` are the
exceptions: they stream raw bytes and NDJSON respectively, so they reject
`--format`/`--json`. Use `--server <url>` to target an explicit running daemon,
`AGENTSVIEW_SERVER_TOKEN` or `--server-token-file <path>` when that daemon
requires auth, or `--pg` to read from configured PostgreSQL.

`agentsview session list` excludes one-shot and automated sessions by default.
When that hides matching sessions on the first page, it reports the counts and
the corresponding `--include-one-shot` or `--include-automated` flags on stderr.
Stdout, including `--format json`, keeps its existing shape for pipelines.

`AGENTSVIEW_PG_URL`, a legacy `[pg].url`, or the effective default target from
`default_pg` plus `[pg.NAME]` are sync configuration only; they do not change
the default read path. Read commands use local SQLite unless `--pg` is supplied,
in which case they fail fast if no connection URL is available. Mutating
commands such as `session sync` and local-only raw source export continue to use
the local archive.

Use [`agentsview health`](#agentsview-health) for a human-first signal view and
[Session API](/docs/session-api/) for the full programmatic contract, including
daemon-first transport behavior and markdown export details.

`agentsview session list` renders a resume-oriented human table by default,
including a recently-active marker, session ID, age, agent, project, branch,
message count, title, and working directory. Pass `--resume` or its `--active`
alias to show sessions active in the last 15 minutes; combine either flag with
`--active-since <RFC3339>` to choose a wider or narrower window.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview embeddings`

Manage the local semantic search embedding index. Requires `[vector]` to be
enabled in config. See [Semantic Search](/docs/semantic-search/) for full
documentation, including configuration and the search surface.

```bash
agentsview embeddings build           # build or refresh the index
agentsview embeddings list            # list embedding generations
agentsview embeddings activate <id>   # activate a generation
agentsview embeddings retire <id>     # retire a generation
```

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview recall`

Inspect the experimental durable-knowledge layer over the local session archive.
Recall is active research and its corpus may require rebuilding as the schema,
scoring, and trust policy evolve. See [Recall (Experimental)](/docs/recall/) for
its current guarantees and limitations.

```bash
agentsview recall list
agentsview recall get <id>
agentsview recall query <text>
agentsview recall brief <task>
agentsview recall stats
agentsview recall extract run [--session <id>] [--full] [--limit <n>]
agentsview recall extract status
agentsview recall extract activate
agentsview recall extract retire <fingerprint> [--force]
agentsview recall extract doctor
agentsview recall extract preview --session <id>
agentsview recall import <accepted-recall.jsonl> --dry-run
```

Model-backed extraction requires an enabled `[recall.extract]` config section —
see [Recall](/docs/recall/#automatic-extraction). `preview` replaces the earlier
`extract --session <id> --dry-run` form, which still works as a fallback. The
extraction subcommands operate on the local archive only and refuse `--server`;
while a daemon owns the archive, it runs extraction passes itself and manual
`run`/`activate`/`retire` are refused.

Use an isolated `AGENTSVIEW_DATA_DIR` for Recall population experiments. Import
with `--dry-run` first; a write requires `--yes`, and a remote write also
requires `--allow-remote-import`. Import against the default production
directory is refused unless `--allow-production-import` is supplied explicitly.
These flags do not bypass Recall's trust or evidence checks.

When `--server <url>` targets an explicit daemon, provide remote credentials
with `AGENTSVIEW_SERVER_TOKEN` or `--server-token-file <path>`. Recall never
sends the local daemon token from `config.toml` to an explicitly supplied
server.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview insight`

Generate and inspect stored Activity Insights through the daemon API.

```bash
agentsview insight list [--type <type>] [--project <project>] \
  [--date-from <date>] [--date-to <date>]
agentsview insight get <id>
agentsview insight generate --type daily_activity --date-from <date> \
  --date-to <date> [flags]
```

`insight list` accepts `--type`, `--project`, `--date-from`, and `--date-to`.
`insight get` prints one saved insight. Use `--format json` or `--json` for the
API envelope and complete stored rows. Human output prints a table for list and
the saved Markdown content for get.

`insight generate` accepts `--type`, `--date-from`, `--date-to`, `--project`,
`--prompt`, `--session-id`, `--agent`, `--automated-scope`, and `--timezone`.
The type defaults to `daily_activity`. The server validates fields, selects the
configured agent or endpoint, and decides whether the selected backend can save
the result. Local commands discover or start the configured daemon; an explicit
`--server <url>` targets an already running server.

Generation status and log events go to stderr. The saved insight is the only
result written to stdout, which keeps JSON output usable in scripts. For an
explicit server, provide its bearer token with `AGENTSVIEW_SERVER_TOKEN` or
`--server-token-file <path>`. The local daemon token from `config.toml` is never
sent to an explicitly supplied server.

### `agentsview mcp`

Run a read-only Model Context Protocol server for assistant clients that can
call MCP tools. The server exposes session search, listing, overview, message
retrieval, content search, and usage-summary tools over the same service layer
used by the CLI and HTTP API. See [MCP Server](/docs/mcp/) for setup examples
and operational guidance.

```bash
agentsview mcp
agentsview mcp --http 127.0.0.1:8085
agentsview mcp --server http://127.0.0.1:8080
agentsview mcp status --json
```

`agentsview mcp status --json` lists local HTTP MCP listeners without starting
one; stdio connections do not appear. See
[listener discovery](/docs/mcp/#discover-running-http-listeners) for endpoint
fields and token-file paths.

By default, `agentsview mcp` speaks stdio, which is the expected transport for
local MCP clients such as Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Codex.
`--http <addr>` serves StreamableHTTP instead. Bare ports and `:PORT` values
bind to `127.0.0.1`; non-loopback binds require `--http-allow-insecure` plus a
configured bearer token.

Local MCP mode is daemon-backed. Each tool call resolves the local AgentsView
daemon and starts it when needed, so a long-lived MCP server can keep working
after the daemon exits due to idleness. The MCP server does not fall back to
opening the local SQLite archive directly.

Use `--server <url>` to point at an explicit running daemon. When the daemon
requires auth, provide `AGENTSVIEW_SERVER_TOKEN` or
`--server-token-file <path>`. Use `--pg` to read from configured PostgreSQL
directly, or run [`agentsview pg serve`](/docs/pg-sync/#agentsview-pg-serve) and
pass its URL with `--server`.

| Flag                         | Default | Description                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--http <addr>`              |         | Serve StreamableHTTP instead of stdio               |
| `--http-allow-insecure`      | `false` | Allow non-loopback HTTP binds; requires bearer auth |
| `--server <url>`             |         | Explicit daemon URL for MCP tool calls              |
| `--server-token-file <path>` |         | Bearer token file for an explicit daemon URL        |
| `--pg`                       | `false` | Read from configured PostgreSQL                     |

### `agentsview secrets`

Scan for and list detected secret leaks across sessions, with matches redacted
by default. See [Secret Scanning](/docs/session-api/#secret-scanning) for the
full detector set, storage shape, and HTTP API.

```bash
agentsview secrets scan [flags]   # scan sessions for leaks
agentsview secrets list [flags]   # list stored findings
```

`secrets scan` walks the archive, applies the full ruleset (definite + candidate
tiers), and writes new findings to the `secret_findings` table. Pass
`--backfill` to scan only sessions that haven't yet been scanned at the current
ruleset version — the inline scan that runs during sync only stamps
definite-tier findings, so `--backfill` is how you pick up the heuristic
candidates without re-scanning the whole archive.

`secrets list` returns redacted findings by default. Pass `--reveal` to print
the raw values — this only works against a localhost-bound daemon and emits a
warning to stderr.

| Flag           | Used by | Description                                                       |
| -------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--format`     | both    | `human` or `json` (inherited from `secrets`)                      |
| `--json`       | both    | Alias for `--format json` (inherited from `secrets`)              |
| `--backfill`   | scan    | Scan only sessions not yet scanned at the current ruleset version |
| `--project`    | both    | Limit to a project                                                |
| `--agent`      | both    | Limit to an agent                                                 |
| `--date-from`  | both    | Sessions on or after `YYYY-MM-DD`                                 |
| `--date-to`    | both    | Sessions on or before `YYYY-MM-DD`                                |
| `--rule`       | list    | Filter by rule name (e.g. `aws-access-key`)                       |
| `--confidence` | list    | `definite`, `candidate`, or `all` (default `definite`)            |
| `--reveal`     | list    | Show unredacted values (localhost-only)                           |
| `--limit`      | list    | Max findings (default 50, max 500)                                |
| `--cursor`     | list    | Pagination cursor from a previous response                        |

### `agentsview skills`

Install or list the bundled skill files that teach coding-agent harnesses
(Claude Code, Codex, and other `.agents/skills` readers) to search AgentsView
history. See [Semantic Search](/docs/semantic-search/#skills-for-coding-agents)
for what the skill does and when to re-run it.

```bash
agentsview skills install [--harness claude|agents] [--project] [--force]
    [--server URL] [--server-token-file PATH]
agentsview skills list [--project] [--format json]
    [--server URL] [--server-token-file PATH]
```

`install` renders the embedded `agentsview-finding-history` skill for each
`--harness` (default both) and writes `SKILL.md` under
`~/.claude/skills/agentsview-finding-history/` and/or
`~/.agents/skills/agentsview-finding-history/`, or under `.claude/skills/` /
`.agents/skills/` at the current git root with `--project`. It overwrites an
unmodified generated file, refuses a hand-edited or foreign file unless
`--force` is passed, and exits non-zero on any refusal. `list` reports HARNESS,
LEVEL, STATE (`missing`, `current`, `stale`, `modified`, `foreign`), and PATH
for every harness.

`--server` / `--server-token-file` (or `AGENTSVIEW_SKILLS_SERVER` /
`AGENTSVIEW_SKILLS_SERVER_TOKEN_FILE`) bake those flags into every example
command so a remote-daemon install does not teach the local SQLite default.
Values are shell-quoted, so a token path with a space stays one argument.

Precedence is explicit flags, then whatever the installed file already bakes,
then the environment. An installed file therefore decides even when it bakes no
remote, so exporting `AGENTSVIEW_SKILLS_SERVER` never marks existing skills
stale in `list`; the variables only seed a file that is not installed yet. Pass
`--server ""` to un-bake a remote and go back to a local-SQLite skill.

These variables are skills-only and named apart from `AGENTSVIEW_SERVER_TOKEN`
on purpose: they do not change the CLI's default read path, and `session search`
still needs `--server` unless the baked examples supply it.

## Data Directory

AgentsView stores all persistent data under a single directory, defaulting to
`~/.agentsview/`. Override with the `AGENTSVIEW_DATA_DIR` environment variable.

!!! note

    `AGENT_VIEWER_DATA_DIR` is still accepted as a legacy fallback when
    `AGENTSVIEW_DATA_DIR` is unset, but new setups should use `AGENTSVIEW_DATA_DIR`.

```
~/.agentsview/
├── sessions.db      # SQLite database (WAL mode)
├── assets/          # Images stored outside SQLite
├── vectors.db       # Semantic-search vector index (when [vector] is enabled)
├── usage-cache-v6-<id>.db # Disposable usage-aggregate cache
├── telemetry-install-id # Application installation ID
├── config.toml      # Configuration file
├── config.toml.lock # Serializes concurrent config writers
├── db.write.lock    # Per-data-dir SQLite write-owner lock
├── serve.log        # Detached daemon log
└── uploads/         # Uploaded session files
```

`usage-cache-v6-<id>.db` is a derived cache of usage aggregates, not user data.
It is safe to delete when no AgentsView process is running; the next usage query
rebuilds it automatically. Back up `sessions.db` for session history, `assets/`
for images stored outside SQLite, `config.toml` for settings, and
`telemetry-install-id` for installation identity. Keep the database and assets
together when restoring or moving the archive.

The desktop app and CLI share a detached local daemon for fresh reads and
writes. A running daemon owns local SQLite writes for this data directory and
self-exits after an idle period. Ordinary session commands require the daemon.
Dedicated diagnostics, including `db adopt-machine --list` and `doctor sync`,
can inspect the archive without starting it. Set `AGENTSVIEW_NO_DAEMON=1` when a
script must never auto-start a daemon; commands that require one will refuse.

The Cursor source in code attribution stats is a live, machine-local read from
`~/.cursor/ai-tracking/ai-code-tracking.db` by default. Set
`AGENTSVIEW_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTION_DB` when Cursor stores that database somewhere
else on the host answering the stats request. The attribution database is not
synced into AgentsView's archive and is not pushed to PostgreSQL.

### Archive content

`archive_content` in `config.toml` controls how much of each session the archive
stores:

```toml
# "full" (default), "transcripts", or "usage"
archive_content = "transcripts"
```

| Value           | What is stored                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"full"`        | Parsed messages, reasoning, titles, tools, and results. Tool-result category and image settings still apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `"transcripts"` | Message text, thinking text, titles, and tool call metadata: names, categories, skill names, the file path a call targeted, result lengths, statuses, and subagent links. Tool inputs and tool results, usually most of a large archive, are dropped, and the one-line tool summaries inside message text keep only the tool name and target path. |
| `"usage"`       | Session metadata, usage values, activity timestamps, and the identifiers needed to connect subagents. Transcript text, thinking text, original tool inputs and results, and session titles are dropped.                                                                                                                                            |

The daemon reads the policy when it starts, so a change takes effect after
`agentsview daemon restart`. The policy applies when rows are written, so
changing it does not rewrite rows already in the archive. To apply a narrower
policy to an existing archive, set the key, restart the daemon, and run
`agentsview sync --full`. The rebuild re-parses sessions whose source files
still exist and copies archived sessions whose sources are gone, projecting both
onto the policy. Back up the archive first: dropped content cannot be restored
without the original source files.

`AGENTSVIEW_ARCHIVE_CONTENT` sets the policy when the config file does not,
which suits a dedicated reporting archive in its own data directory:

```bash
AGENTSVIEW_DATA_DIR=~/.agentsview-usage \
AGENTSVIEW_ARCHIVE_CONTENT=usage \
agentsview sync
```

Limits of the narrower policies:

- `"transcripts"` is a storage policy, not a redaction guarantee. It removes the
    tool payload tables, the structured tool inputs, the rows and summaries that
    parsers mark as tool output, and it rewrites the tool summaries parsers
    inline into message text. Text that a provider wrote into a message body in
    its own format is kept as the provider wrote it. When tool output must never
    be present in the archive, use `"usage"`, which stores no transcript text.
- `"transcripts"` keeps session search, transcript viewing, and tool analytics
    working, but signals and secret findings that read tool inputs or results
    (tool failure detection, repeated identical calls, secrets inside tool
    output) see empty payloads. `result_content_blocked_categories` has no
    additional effect under this policy. Archived RooCode, Kilo Legacy, gptme,
    OpenHands, Aider, Codex, TraeX, and Zencoder sessions parsed before data
    version 105 and whose source files are gone cannot be re-parsed, so a
    rebuild drops every row shape those parsers once used for tool output. This
    includes user turns for OpenHands, Codex, and TraeX; assistant replies for
    Aider; and system-flagged notices for Zencoder. Copied OpenHands actions
    with event summaries keep the prose before the tool header and the tool
    label, but lose the summary and all following text, including appended
    thinking, because the archive does not retain the summary boundaries. The
    semantic search mirror keeps previously embedded text until the next embedding
    pass refreshes it. With `[vector.embed] run_after_sync` enabled (the
    default) that pass starts right after the rebuild; otherwise let the
    scheduled pass run before pushing vectors to PostgreSQL.
- `"usage"` supports usage reports such as `agentsview usage daily`. Session
    search, transcript viewing, tool analytics, and content-derived quality
    metrics require a fuller archive. Insights and recall entries are refused,
    since both hold transcript-derived text. Recall extraction stops before
    calling a model, including for old rows awaiting a rebuild. Raw
    `session export` is also disabled. Vector building, search, and export are
    disabled. Opening the writable archive clears existing local message and
    recall indexes, including when `[vector]` is disabled. Run `pg push --full`
    after the archive rebuild to remove indexed content for those sessions from
    PostgreSQL as well. Usage-only pushes also clear session titles, including
    names changed in PostgreSQL. Other sessions in a shared PostgreSQL store are
    unaffected.

### Ingest-time image offload

`tool_result_images = "offload"` stores supported PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF
tool-result images in `{dataDir}/assets/<sha256hex><ext>` before SQLite
publishes their references. Restart the daemon to apply the setting. Failed
writes keep inline content, and archives that omit tool content write no assets.
See [image storage](/docs/data/#ingest-time-image-offload) for retries, backups,
and remote-backend limits.

You can also select **Offload** under **Settings > Archive content**. The
restart notice appears after you save a changed policy.

## Installation Identity

Local sessions use a random installation ID saved in `telemetry-install-id` in
this data directory. AgentsView reuses an existing ID from that file or creates
one, even when telemetry is disabled. PostHog consumes the same ID. Read-only
commands leave the file unchanged.

The ID identifies an installation, not physical hardware. It survives updates,
binary replacements, restarts, and network or hostname changes. A fresh data
directory creates a new ID; copying the data directory copies the identity.
Restore the original `telemetry-install-id` from a backup to keep that identity.
Deleting it deliberately creates a distinct installation; that new installation
does not automatically take ownership of the old one's sessions.

The display label defaults to the current hostname. Set `local_machine_name` in
`config.toml` for a fixed label, then run `agentsview daemon restart`. Any
non-empty label is allowed, including `local`. Changing the label leaves session
keys unchanged; PostgreSQL and DuckDB receive the label on the next push.
Creating the identity does not rewrite `config.toml` or its comments. A missing
cursor secret is still generated and saved. Machine filters use keys;
`/api/v1/machines` returns display labels and known aliases separately.

### Upgrading Historical Machine Keys

At writable startup, AgentsView moves sessions from the archive's recorded local
machine to the installation ID. The saved ownership record was introduced in
v0.40.0; v0.39.0 archives do not have it. Older `local` rows move too. Session
IDs, messages, stars, pins, and other curation remain intact. Worktree rules and
project and source metadata move with the sessions. Conflicting worktree rules
stop the migration so you can reconcile them without losing edits.

Adopted hostnames remain aliases for old filters and URLs. Display labels do not
establish ownership, and other historical hostnames remain separate until you
explicitly select them. Alias keys are reserved redirects: use a peer's
installation ID for a remote source and omit `machine` for a local root.

If an archive has named machines but no saved local ownership, startup keeps
them under their existing keys and logs the keys once. Inspect them with
`agentsview db adopt-machine --list`, which prints machine keys and session
counts without starting a daemon or changing configuration. Stop the daemon,
then run
[`agentsview db adopt-machine`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-db-adopt-machine)
with the old machine keys you own. Keys that belong to other installations need
no action.

PostgreSQL publishes the migrated sessions and metadata on the next incremental
push. DuckDB rebuilds its mirror once when the default machine key changes. The
SQLite archive stays intact. If two installations publish the same old hostname
alias to PostgreSQL, the latest push determines its filter target. Use
installation IDs to select machines unambiguously in a shared mirror.

## Config File

The config file at `~/.agentsview/config.toml` is auto-created on first run. It
stores persistent settings that survive restarts.

!!! note

    The config format changed from JSON to TOML. Existing `config.json` files are
    automatically migrated to `config.toml` on first run (the JSON file is renamed
    to `config.json.bak`).

```toml
cursor_secret = "base64-encoded-secret"
require_auth = true
cursor_admin_api_key = "key_xxxxx"
daemon_idle_timeout = "20m"
chart_palette = "agentsview"
zoom_level = 120
```

The `cursor_secret` is generated automatically on first run. For Gist
publishing, AgentsView first uses a saved `github_token`. For local browser
requests, if no token is saved, it then tries `AGENTSVIEW_GITHUB_TOKEN` and then
`gh auth token` from the GitHub CLI. Local users usually only need to run
`gh auth login`. For remote or proxied access, save a `github_token` via the web
UI Settings page or the API endpoint `POST /api/v1/config/github` when you want
AgentsView to publish gists. Remote access fields can be configured via the
Settings page or CLI flags — see [Remote Access](/docs/remote-access/) for
details.

`agentsview daemon start` and `agentsview daemon restart` load the normal
effective configuration from this file and supported environment variables; they
accept no serve-specific flags. `--no-sync` is a runtime-only `serve` option and
cannot be stored in `config.toml`.

Unknown keys anywhere under `[vector]` stop configuration loading, even when
vector search is disabled. After upgrading, correct misspelled keys and move
endpoint settings such as `max_batch_tokens` under
`[vector.embeddings.servers.<name>]`. See the
[vector configuration reference](/docs/semantic-search/#enabling-vector).

When `require_auth` is enabled, the browser login prompt accepts the configured
`auth_token`. The value can come from `~/.agentsview/config.toml` or from the
`AGENTSVIEW_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable; the environment variable wins when
both are set.

!!! note

    Older configs may still contain `remote_access = true`. AgentsView still reads
    that legacy key for backward compatibility, but new setups should use
    `require_auth = true`.

## Remote Hosts

Add `[[remote_hosts]]` entries when a bare `agentsview sync` should pull raw
session files from other machines after the local sync finishes. SSH remains the
default transport:

```toml
[[remote_hosts]]
host = "buildbox"
transport = "ssh" # optional; default
user = "wes"
port = 2222
```

For daemon-backed HTTP sync, run an AgentsView daemon on the remote host and
secure reachability with a private network such as Tailscale:

```toml
[[remote_hosts]]
host = "devbox1"
transport = "http"
url = "http://devbox1.tailnet.ts.net:8080"
token = "remote-token"
interval = "5m" # optional; zero or omitted means manual sync only
```

HTTP remote sync calls the remote daemon's archive endpoints and always uses a
bearer token, even when the rest of that daemon has `require_auth = false`. The
per-host `token` is required and must match the remote daemon's `auth_token`. Do
not reuse the collector daemon's own `auth_token` for untrusted remote
endpoints. HTTP transfers use a persistent per-host mirror and request file
deltas when fewer than half of the manifest files need fetching; see
[Remote Access — Incremental Sync](/docs/remote-access/#incremental-sync).

When a full or automatic data-version rebuild includes local sources, configured
HTTP hosts join the same temporary-database bulk ingest and atomic swap.
`--full` reparses the complete local and remote corpus without retransferring
unchanged files from manifest-capable spokes. HTTP remote sync requires the
collector and remote daemon to use the same remote-sync protocol version. After
upgrading either host, upgrade the other before syncing again; incompatible
peers fail before targets or archive data are exchanged.

Each `remote_hosts.host` value must be unique and stable. It namespaces imported
session IDs, the database skip cache, and the persistent mirror; changing it for
the same machine can duplicate sessions, while reusing it for another machine
can reuse stale state. A configured HTTP host can be selected later with
`agentsview sync --host <name>`, but ad hoc HTTP remotes are not supported;
without a matching configured host, `--host` remains an SSH remote sync. HTTP
remote sync is the recommended transport. SSH remote sync is deprecated and
receives only critical fixes. HTTP failures are summarized with actionable
messages for common cases such as token rejection, missing remote archive
endpoints, connection refusal, DNS failures, and timeouts.

Set `interval` to a positive duration such as `"5m"` to have a running collector
daemon sync that host periodically. Zero or omitted disables the per-host
schedule; manual `agentsview sync` still includes the host.

The remote daemon must also listen on an interface the collector can reach. The
server binds `127.0.0.1` by default, so set `host` in the remote machine's
`config.toml` with `require_auth = true` for a persistent node:

```toml
host = "0.0.0.0"
require_auth = true
```

Then start or restart the config-driven writable daemon:

```bash
agentsview daemon start
# After later configuration changes:
agentsview daemon restart
```

For a one-off flag override, `agentsview serve --background --host 0.0.0.0`
remains available, including without auth. Prefer authenticated persistent
configuration for an always-available remote node.

Detached writable daemons started by `agentsview daemon start`, automatic CLI
startup, or `agentsview serve --background` exit after `daemon_idle_timeout`
when idle. Set it to zero on machines that should stay available for HTTP remote
sync:

```toml
daemon_idle_timeout = "0s"
```

Supervised daemons run under systemd, launchd, Docker, or a foreground shell do
not create the detached-daemon idle tracker, so they do not idle-exit regardless
of this setting.

## Cursor Admin Usage API

`agentsview usage cursor` imports Cursor Admin API usage events into the local
archive so Cursor's billed usage can appear in the Usage dashboard and
`agentsview usage daily` reports. Set the API key in
`~/.agentsview/config.toml`:

```toml
cursor_admin_api_key = "key_xxxxx"
cursor_admin_email = "you@example.com" # optional
cursor_admin_user_id = "152683922"     # optional
```

Environment variables take precedence over the config file:

```bash
export AGENTSVIEW_CURSOR_ADMIN_API_KEY=key_xxxxx
export AGENTSVIEW_CURSOR_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com
export AGENTSVIEW_CURSOR_ADMIN_USER_ID=152683922
```

The legacy unprefixed names `CURSOR_ADMIN_API_KEY`, `CURSOR_ADMIN_EMAIL`, and
`CURSOR_ADMIN_USER_ID` are also accepted when the matching `AGENTSVIEW_`
variable is unset. The email and user ID values are default filters; pass
`--email` or `--user-id` to `agentsview usage cursor` to override them for one
import.

## Session Discovery

AgentsView auto-discovers session files from the following agent sources. Amp
support is deprecated because current Amp releases may keep full threads
server-side and leave only local stubs; historical local Amp thread JSON files
can still be parsed.

The matching environment variable and `agents.<id>.dirs` configuration key
override an agent's default directories. Environment variables take precedence
when both are set. An explicit empty `agents.<id>.dirs` array, such as
`agents.grok.dirs = []`, clears that agent's default local directories, so local
discovery finds nothing there. Matching `session_sources` entries for that agent
still apply. Provider-wide exclusion is documented under
[Disabling Session Providers](#disabling-session-providers). Omitting the key
keeps its default directories.

**Augure Code** reads Codex-format JSONL from `~/.augure/sessions/` and appears
under the separate `augure-code` agent ID. Set `AUGURE_CODE_SESSIONS_DIR` or
`agents.augure-code.dirs` for another sessions root. Resume these sessions with
`augure resume`, not `codex resume`.

**Augure Desktop 3 beta** reads `state.db` and its `sessions/` sibling from
`~/.augure-desktop/` on macOS and Linux, or `~/AppData/Local/augure-desktop/` on
Windows. Set `AUGURE_DESKTOP_DIR` or `agents.augure-desktop.dirs` to use another
data root. These sessions appear as `augure-desktop`, separately from Augure
Code and Hermes. Local browsing, search, exports, and recorded usage are
supported; remote source-file sync is disabled for this provider.

**Cline support covers the CLI**, not the VS Code extension. Set `CLINE_DIR` or
`agents.cline.dirs` to its data root or directly to its sessions directory.
AgentsView reads the CLI's conversations, tool activity, usage, and recorded
costs, including through remote sync. Continued teammate runs remain separate
sessions, matching Cline's own store.

DeepSeek Harness sessions are read from its default JSONL persistence backend,
including released format versions 0 through 3 in plain or zstd-compressed
files. Version 0 uses `session.jsonl[.zstd]`; later versions use
`session.vN.jsonl[.zstd]`. When a session directory retains multiple immutable
generations, AgentsView reads the numerically newest supported generation.
Inherited parent transcript content is excluded from child sessions. `DSH_HOME`
re-roots the default `<home>/sessions` path; set `DEEPSEEK_HARNESS_SESSIONS_DIR`
or `agents.deepseek-harness.dirs` to point directly at one or more session
roots. The optional SQLite persistence backend is not supported.

Prime Agent support targets the current flat session layout in v0.7.0. That
release migrates the older per-project layout when Prime Agent opens its session
store, so open the current Prime Agent once before syncing a legacy archive with
AgentsView.

Tau stores multiple session transcripts in each project directory under
`~/.tau/sessions/`. AgentsView reads `.jsonl` files directly below those project
directories, excludes the exact `index.jsonl` metadata file, and follows the
latest `leaf` entry when selecting the active history. Set `TAU_SESSIONS_DIR` or
`agents.tau.dirs` to use another sessions root.

User-run shell commands (`bashExecution`) and messages with the `custom`,
`branchSummary`, or `compactionSummary` role are not shown. Separate
`branch_summary` and `compaction` entries are shown.

**Qoder default directories** include the legacy `~/.qoder/projects/` and
`~/.qoderwork/projects/` export roots, the Qoder CLI CN store, and the current
IDE store:

- **Qoder CLI CN:** `~/.qoder-cn/projects/`

- **macOS:**
    `~/Library/Application Support/Qoder/SharedClientCache/cli/projects/`

- **Linux:** `~/.config/Qoder/SharedClientCache/cli/projects/`

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Qoder\SharedClientCache\cli\projects\`

Set `QODER_PROJECTS_DIR` or `agents.qoder.dirs` to replace these defaults with
one or more explicit roots.

Grok sessions are read from `summary.json` (title, timestamps, project),
optional `signals.json` (token counters), and `chat_history.jsonl` when present
for the full transcript (user turns, assistant replies, thinking, and tool
calls). If `chat_history.jsonl` is missing, AgentsView falls back to
summary-only mode. Set `GROK_DIR` or `agents.grok.dirs` to override the default
directory.

**Goose default directories** are:

- **macOS and Linux:** `~/.local/share/goose/sessions/`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Block/goose/data/sessions/`

`GOOSE_PATH_ROOT` follows Goose's own path-root convention and resolves
`<root>/data/sessions/sessions.db`. A `agents.goose.dirs` entry may instead
point directly to that sessions directory, its parent data directory, or the
database file.

**Crush default directories** are:

- **macOS and Linux:** `~/.local/share/crush/`
- **Windows:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%/crush/`

AgentsView reads `projects.json` in that directory and discovers one SQLite
`crush.db` per project under each listed `<project>/.crush/` data directory. Set
`CRUSH_DIR` or `agents.crush.dirs` to override the default with one or more
directories: each entry may be a Crush data directory (containing
`projects.json`), a `<project>/.crush` directory, or a `crush.db` file. A
project added after AgentsView starts is picked up by the next scheduled
reconciliation pass.

Omnigent sessions are read from `~/.omnigent/chat.db`. Set `OMNIGENT_DIR` or
`agents.omnigent.dirs` to override the default directory. AgentsView creates one
session per conversation and supports the split text-ID and current binary-UUID
schema generations; the older single-table schema is detected and reported as
unsupported without losing sessions already synced from it. Remote HTTP and SSH
sync stay disabled for Omnigent because `chat.db` co-locates transcripts with
authentication secrets. A metadata-only edit made directly in `chat.db` can be
deferred by the immediate filesystem-event sync; the next scheduled
reconciliation pass or an explicit resync picks it up.

**VS Code Copilot default directories** vary by platform:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Code/User/`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Code/User/`

Code Insiders and VSCodium variants are also discovered automatically.

**Visual Studio Copilot default directories** vary by platform:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Caches/VSGitHubCopilotLogs/traces/`
- **Linux:** `~/.cache/VSGitHubCopilotLogs/traces/`
- **Windows:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Temp/VSGitHubCopilotLogs/traces/`

This is separate from VS Code Copilot. Visual Studio Copilot stores trace files
named like `*_VSGitHubCopilot_traces.jsonl`; set `VISUALSTUDIO_COPILOT_DIR` or
`agents.visualstudio-copilot.dirs` if your installation writes them elsewhere.

**Windsurf default directories** vary by platform:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Windsurf/User/` and
    `~/Library/Application Support/Windsurf - Next/User/`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Windsurf/User/` and `~/.config/Windsurf - Next/User/`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Windsurf/User/` and `%APPDATA%/Windsurf - Next/User/`

Windsurf stores workspace chats in `workspaceStorage/<hash>/state.vscdb`.

**Trae default directories** vary by platform:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Trae/User/`, `Trae CN/User/`, and
    `TRAE SOLO CN/User/`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Trae/User/`, `Trae CN/User/`, and `TRAE SOLO CN/User/`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Trae/User/`, `Trae CN/User/`, and `TRAE SOLO CN/User/`

Trae stores chats in `workspaceStorage/<hash>/state.vscdb` and
`globalStorage/state.vscdb`. Override these roots with `TRAE_DIR` or the
`agents.trae.dirs` configuration key. AgentsView watches `workspaceStorage` and
`globalStorage`, then reads chat records from those SQLite stores.

Trae legacy inline-message parsing is supported. Modern encrypted transcript
layouts are detected and reported as unsupported. Remote HTTP and SSH target
resolution is still disabled. A Trae root is a full user profile, and AgentsView
does not archive or ship that profile wholesale. The follow-up path is
Windsurf-style curated file targets only: `state.vscdb`, `state.vscdb-wal`, and
`workspace.json` for each supported workspace store.

**Kimi Work default directories** vary by platform. Kimi Work is the
kimi-desktop app (the "daimon" runtime); it stores conversations as kimi-code
kernel wire logs under
`<root>/wd_<workspace>_<hash>/<session>/agents/<agent>/wire.jsonl`:

- **macOS:**
    `~/Library/Application Support/kimi-desktop/daimon-share/daimon/runtime/kimi-code/home/sessions/`
- **Linux:**
    `~/.config/kimi-desktop/daimon-share/daimon/runtime/kimi-code/home/sessions/`
    (or `~/.local/share/...` on some installs)
- **Windows:**
    `%APPDATA%/kimi-desktop/daimon-share/daimon/runtime/kimi-code/home/sessions/`

Only `conv-*` session directories are user conversations; auxiliary internal
sessions (`ctitle-*`, `sklsum-*`, `dvlt-*`) are excluded from discovery. Set
`KIMI_WORK_DIR` or `agents.kimi-work.dirs` if your installation stores them
elsewhere.

**Positron Assistant default directory** (macOS only):

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Positron/User/`

Positron is an IDE built on VS Code, so sessions use the same
`workspaceStorage/<hash>/chatSessions/` layout as VS Code Copilot. As of
v0.20.0, Positron Assistant has a built-in default path only on macOS — on Linux
and Windows, set `POSITRON_DIR` or `agents.positron.dirs` to point at your
Positron user directory (for example, `~/.config/Positron/User` on Linux or
`%APPDATA%\Positron\User` on Windows).

**Posit Assistant** (posit-dev/assistant, also known as Databot) is a separate
product from the Positron IDE's built-in Assistant above. It stores one
directory per conversation under
`~/.posit/assistant/workspaces/<workspaceId>/<conversationId>/`, containing a
`conversation.json` message tree and an append-only `lm-messages.jsonl`
transcript; subagent runs nest under a `subagents/` subdirectory of their parent
conversation. All Posit Assistant hosts (Positron/VS Code extension, standalone,
desktop, TUI) share this location. Set `POSIT_ASSISTANT_DIR` or
`agents.posit-assistant.dirs` if your installation stores its workspaces
elsewhere.

**Cursor IDE** is the graphical editor, distinct from the Cursor command-line
agent above. AgentsView reads Composer sessions from Cursor's shared
`globalStorage/state.vscdb` database. The default follows Cursor's normal user
data directory on macOS, Linux, and Windows; set `CURSOR_IDE_DIR` or
`agents.cursor-ide.dirs` to override it. This database also contains
authentication and extension state, so Cursor IDE is deliberately excluded from
remote source-file sync. Parsed sessions still stay in the local archive and can
be shared through the normal PostgreSQL or DuckDB paths.

**Claude Cowork default directories** follow Claude Desktop's Electron user-data
location:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/`
- **Windows:**
    `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Claude_pzs8sxrjxfjjc\LocalCache\Roaming\Claude\local-agent-mode-sessions\`
    or `%APPDATA%\Claude\local-agent-mode-sessions\`

Set `COWORK_DIR` or `agents.cowork.dirs` when Claude Desktop stores
local-agent-mode sessions somewhere else.

**Codebuff / Freebuff sessions:** Codebuff and Freebuff share the same on-disk
layout under `~/.config/manicode/projects/`. Each session is a timestamped
directory containing `chat-messages.json` (the full transcript with subagent
invocations), `run-state.json` (metadata including the agent type and model),
and optional `chat-meta.json`.

AgentsView auto-classifies each session as **Codebuff** (paid) or **Freebuff**
(free tier) based on the `agentType` field in `run-state.json`: sessions whose
`agentType` contains `"free"` are filed under Freebuff. Both agent types appear
as separate filters in the session list so you can view paid and free sessions
independently.

Subagent tool calls (basher, code-searcher, file-picker, code-reviewer, etc.)
are parsed from the AI message blocks and displayed inline in the transcript
view. The agent template (e.g. `base2-free-deepseek`, `base2-free-mimo`) is read
from run-state.json's `agentType` field and shown in the session detail header.
This is the classification label used server-side to pick the per-step LLM; the
literal LLM is not persisted by the CLI and is not visible in the UI. Project
names are derived from the session's working directory via git-root detection.

Codebuff and Freebuff sessions report cost only. The CLI's on-disk format does
not persist per-message input/output/cache tokens, so the daily usage model
breakdown shows the cost-attributed agent template (e.g. `base2-deepseek`,
`base2-free-minimax-m3`) without per-message token figures. Reported-cost rows
ride as microdollars on `money.Money` like every other agent, and per-model
rates for `base2-*` templates are not in the embedded pricing tables, so cache
savings for these rows resolve to zero by design rather than an aggregator bug.

Freebuff does not have its own environment variable or config key — it shares
the Codebuff provider for discovery and the parser auto-classifies sessions. Set
`CODEBUFF_DIR` or `agents.codebuff.dirs` when manicode stores its projects
directory somewhere other than `~/.config/manicode/projects`; this covers both
Codebuff and Freebuff sessions.

**OpenHands CLI shallow watch:** OpenHands stores each conversation in its own
subdirectory, which would consume one recursive file watch per session and can
exhaust inotify limits on Linux. AgentsView watches the root
`~/.openhands/conversations/` directory non-recursively and relies on the
15-minute periodic sync to pick up changes inside existing conversations. New
conversation directories are still detected immediately. The server's startup
log reports how many directories are watched this way:

```
Watching 74 directories for changes (2 shallow) (76ms)
```

**Devin CLI root:** Point `DEVIN_DIR` or `agents.devin.dirs` at the local root
that contains Devin's `cli/` directory, not at copied config or OAuth files. The
default roots are `~/Library/Application Support/devin` on macOS and
`~/.local/share/devin` on Linux, and AgentsView discovers session data under
`<root>/cli/...`. When sharing a path publicly, redact parent directories and
keep only the relevant tail, for example `.../Application Support/devin` or
`.../.local/share/devin`.

AgentsView intentionally ignores copied config/OAuth locations because those
paths are not the session archive source and may contain sensitive account
material. When filing bugs, share only the redacted local-share root and
directory shape, never pasted tokens, OAuth files, or other secrets.

**OpenCode storage backend:** As of 0.24.0, AgentsView reads both of OpenCode's
layouts. If a `storage/session/` directory exists under the OpenCode root,
sessions are parsed from the per-file JSON layout (`storage/session`,
`storage/message`, `storage/part`); otherwise the legacy `opencode.db` SQLite
file is used. Detection is automatic and requires no configuration. In storage
mode, the file watcher scopes itself to the `storage/` subtree rather than the
entire OpenCode directory, so unrelated OpenCode state like binaries, logs, and
caches no longer trigger sync events. In SQLite mode, it watches the
`opencode.db` parent.

Kilo and MiMoCode use the same OpenCode-format storage reader. Kilo reads from
`storage/session`, while MiMoCode reads from `storage/session_diff` when
present; both fall back to their SQLite databases when the file-backed storage
layout is absent.

**aider discovery:** aider writes one `.aider.chat.history.md` file per
repository instead of a central session directory. AgentsView does not scan for
Aider logs unless you opt in with `AIDER_DIR` or `agents.aider.dirs`. Always-on
home-directory discovery has caused unwanted macOS privacy prompts from
background refreshes, so Aider discovery is limited to roots you explicitly
configure. On macOS, broad home roots still skip protected top-level folders
unless one of those folders is configured directly.

**Warp default directories** vary by platform:

- **macOS:**
    `~/Library/Group Containers/2BBY89MBSN.dev.warp/Library/Application Support/dev.warp.Warp-Stable/`
- **Linux:** `~/.local/state/warp-terminal/`
- **Windows:** `~/AppData/Local/warp/Warp/data/`

**Zed default directories** vary by platform:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/`
- **Linux:** `~/.local/share/zed/`
- **Windows:** `~/AppData/Local/Zed/`

Zed stores all assistant threads in a single `threads/threads.db` SQLite
database under its data directory. AgentsView reads it directly, including model
names and per-request token usage.

**Kiro IDE default directories** vary by platform:

- **macOS:**
    `~/Library/Application Support/Kiro/User/globalStorage/kiro.kiroagent/`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Kiro/User/globalStorage/kiro.kiroagent/`
- **Windows:** `~/AppData/Roaming/Kiro/User/globalStorage/kiro.kiroagent/`

**RooCode default directories** vary by platform:

- **macOS:**
    `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/`
- **Windows:**
    `~/AppData/Roaming/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/`

RooCode (rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline) is a VSCode extension that stores sessions
under `tasks/<taskId>/` in VSCode's globalStorage directory. Each task directory
contains `history_item.json` (metadata including task description, model name,
workspace path, token counts, and recorded cost) and `ui_messages.json` (the
Cline-format transcript with user prompts, assistant responses, reasoning
blocks, and tool calls). AgentsView parses the `apiConfigName` field from
`history_item.json` as the session model, extracts project names from the
workspace path via git-root detection, and emits the recorded `totalCost` as a
usage event for cost tracking.

RooCode was shut down on May 15, 2026. ZooCode (Zoo-CodeInc.zoo-cline) is the
active community fork and will be supported separately. Set `ROOCODE_DIR` or
`agents.roocode.dirs` if your VSCode globalStorage directory is elsewhere.

**Kilo (legacy) default directories** vary by platform, all rooted at the
canonical lowercase `kilocode.kilo-code` global storage directory that VSCode
writes on disk:

- **macOS:**
    `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/kilocode.kilo-code/`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/kilocode.kilo-code/`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Code/User/globalStorage/kilocode.kilo-code/`

Each `<root>/tasks/<uuid>/` task directory carries three JSON files:
`task_metadata.json` (only stores `files_in_context`), the Claude-shaped
`api_conversation_history.json`, and the Cline-shaped `ui_messages.json`.
AgentsView folds the latter two into a composite fingerprint with
`task_metadata.json` as the source anchor so changes to any of the three trigger
a reparse. Sessions are parsed through RooCode-descended Cline message handling
(tool-call and result pairing, reasoning pipeline, compact boundaries, error
linking). Set `KILO_LEGACY_DIR` or `agents.kilo-legacy.dirs` when the legacy
extension stores its data outside the standard locations.

**Kilo (legacy) vs Kilo.** These are two different agents. *Kilo* (the `kilo`
agent) is the OpenCode-based core at `~/.local/share/kilo/`; it covers both the
Kilo CLI and the rebuilt Kilo Code VS Code extension, which share that same
`kilo.db`. *Kilo (legacy)* (the `kilo-legacy` agent) is the legacy
RooCode-derived VS Code extension that wrote per-task JSON under
`kilocode.kilo-code/tasks/` and stopped receiving new sessions after Kilo
rebuilt the extension on OpenCode (public beta 2026-03-10, GA 2026-04-02). The
`kilo-legacy` agent is frozen at that legacy format and only archives older
sessions; newer Kilo VS Code activity appears under `kilo`.

**Antigravity CLI transcript sources:** Antigravity CLI has used both SQLite
databases and AES-encrypted `.pb` files. AgentsView reads whichever source is
richest, in this order:

1. **Decrypted trajectory sidecar.** For either format, if a
    `<uuid>.trajectory.json` file sits next to the source `.db` or `.pb` file
    (under `conversations/` or `implicit/`) and covers the session, AgentsView
    uses it as the source of truth for the full structured transcript —
    messages, tool calls, tool results, reasoning, and diffs. This is the
    highest-fidelity source for both formats. These sidecars are written
    out-of-process by [agy-reader](https://github.com/mjacobs/agy-reader),
    which performs the decryption; AgentsView reads the resulting plain JSON as
    untrusted input and needs no `ANTIGRAVITY_KEY` in this mode.
1. **SQLite trajectory database.** Newer Antigravity CLI releases write
    `conversations/<uuid>.db`. Without a covering sidecar (above), AgentsView
    opens the database read-only and decodes the trajectory steps directly.
    This direct decode is heuristic: it recovers prompts and tool-call names
    but not full structured tool results, reasoning, or diffs — a degraded
    **summary mode** transcript. If both `conversations/<uuid>.db` and
    `conversations/<uuid>.pb` exist, the SQLite database wins. Change detection
    also factors in `<uuid>.db-wal` and `<uuid>.db-shm` so active sessions
    resync as SQLite sidecar files move.
1. **In-process `.pb` decryption.** With no sidecar present, set
    `ANTIGRAVITY_KEY` (base64-encoded AES key, 16/24/32 bytes after decoding)
    before starting AgentsView and it decrypts the `.pb` payloads itself,
    mirroring the upstream Python tool
    [`antigravity_decryptor`](https://github.com/arashz/antigravity_decryptor).
1. **Plaintext summary mode.** Otherwise AgentsView reads only `history.jsonl`
    and the `brain/` summaries — enough to populate session metadata and a
    high-level transcript.

Any session not backed by a covering sidecar — heuristic `.db` decode,
in-process `.pb` decryption, or plaintext summary mode — shows a "Summary mode"
badge in the detail header. Install `agy-reader` when you want high-resolution
transcripts for `.db` and `.pb` sessions alike:

```bash
go install github.com/mjacobs/agy-reader@latest
agy-reader --sync
agy-reader --watch
```

Override any default with an environment variable (single directory). For Aider,
this opt-in is required because there is no default discovery root:

### CodeBuddy

Tencent CodeBuddy CN uses the `codebuddy` agent ID and reads `history` beneath
the configured `CodeBuddyExtension/Data` directory. On Windows the default data
directory follows `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, with `~/AppData/Local` as a fallback when
that variable is unset or not absolute. macOS uses
`~/Library/Application Support/CodeBuddyExtension/Data`; Linux uses
`~/.config/CodeBuddyExtension/Data`. `CODEBUDDY_DIR` replaces these defaults.

Session projects use the working directory when present, falling back to the
workspace identifier. Message changes, including deletion, refresh their owning
session; workspace index changes refresh sessions in that workspace. See the
[format evidence](https://github.com/kenn-io/agentsview/blob/main/docs/internal/session-format-sources.md#codebuddy)
for usage accounting assumptions and verification limits.

### Evener

Evener discovery reads semantic transcript **format v2** under
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/evener/projects/<project-id>/sessions/`, falling back to
`~/.local/state/evener/projects/`. Override the state root with `EVENER_DIR` or
`agents.evener.dirs`; an explicit project state directory or sessions directory
also works. Older transcript versions are unsupported; existing archive data is
not deleted.

```toml
[agents.evener]
dirs = ["~/session-sources/evener"]
```

The provider reads messages, thinking, tools, recorded usage, session names, and
fork/subagent relationships. Metadata-only edits refresh the session. Verified
copied fork prefixes are omitted from child sessions, following the Codex
provider policy. If the parent is missing or cannot be verified, child history
is retained and shared usage may appear in both sessions.

Costs represent recorded conversation usage, not provider invoices. Model switch
records with structured identities update the model context; an older prose-only
switch cannot establish a fallback billing model. Explicit per-response model
identities still take precedence. Media that cannot be represented by the
existing transcript view is shown as a descriptive placeholder, without fetching
referenced files or URLs.

Remote sync uses Agentsview's existing mechanisms. This provider does not
connect to Evener hubs or add an S3/SSH transport. SSH transfers skip Evener
files whose full paths contain backslashes, which tar can interpret as escape
sequences. Remote sync skips files deleted after discovery, including metadata
left behind when its transcript is deleted.

### Disabling Session Providers

Exclude session providers you do not use by listing their IDs in
`disabled_agents`:

```toml
disabled_agents = ["gemini"]
```

Because Freebuff shares the Codebuff provider, listing `"codebuff"` disables
local filesystem ingestion for both Codebuff and Freebuff.

The setting applies only to local filesystem discovery, targeted local file
sync, file watching, and scheduled polling. It does not affect HTTP or SSH
remote imports, and it does not restrict HTTP, SSH, PostgreSQL, DuckDB, or
archive exports. `RemoteSyncExcluded` is the separate provider capability that
keeps unsafe source trees out of remote exports.

Restart the AgentsView daemon and any separate `pg push --watch`,
`clickhouse push --watch`, or `duckdb push --watch` process after changing the
setting. Previously archived sessions from a disabled provider remain available
and exportable, including during archive rebuilds. The setting does not disable
that provider as a Recall execution backend.

### Multiple Directories

To scan more than one directory per agent — for example, when running Windows
and WSL side by side — add array fields to `~/.agentsview/config.toml`:

```toml
[agents.claude]
dirs = [
  "~/.claude/projects",
  "/mnt/c/Users/you/.claude/projects",
]

[agents.codex]
dirs = [
  "~/.codex/sessions",
]

[agents.opencodereview]
dirs = ["~/.opencodereview/sessions"]
```

Every locally discovered provider uses the same `[agents.<id>]` table with a
`dirs` array. Use its provider ID, such as `claude`, `codex`, `pi`, or `gemini`.
Environment variables take precedence over `dirs`. A non-empty array replaces
the default paths, and an explicit empty array clears the default local roots.

On normal startup, AgentsView converts existing top-level directory and home
keys to these tables and saves the result. Read-only commands interpret the old
format without rewriting it. If both forms set the same field, startup reports
the conflict and leaves the file unchanged; remove one of the entries. Settings
writes only the new format. Conversion preserves unrelated settings, but
rewrites TOML formatting and comments.

All listed directories are discovered, watched, and synced independently.

Pi also honors its native `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` and
`PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` variables in local and SSH discovery. The agent
home variable changes the default to `<agent-home>/sessions`; the session
variable points directly at a session directory. `PI_DIR` takes precedence over
`PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`, which takes precedence over `agents.pi.dirs` in
`config.toml`. A configured `agents.pi.dirs` array replaces the home-derived
default; an empty array clears it. With no overrides, Pi uses
`~/.pi/agent/sessions`.

### Alternate Agent Homes

Claude Code, Codex, and Pi support alternate homes. Each home can hold a
separate account or settings profile. Register the home directories themselves
in `homes`; AgentsView derives their native session directories:

```toml
[agents.claude]
homes = ["~/.claude-work", "~/.t3code/instances/alpha/claude"]

[agents.codex]
homes = ["~/.codex-work", "~/.t3code/instances/alpha/codex"]

[agents.pi]
homes = ["~/.pi-work/agent", "~/.pi-personal/agent"]
```

| Agent       | Home variable         | Transcripts scanned                             | Sidecars read from each home           |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`   | `<home>/projects/`                              | none                                   |
| Codex       | `CODEX_HOME`          | `<home>/sessions/`, `<home>/archived_sessions/` | `history.jsonl`, `session_index.jsonl` |
| Pi          | `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | `<home>/sessions/`                              | none                                   |

Homes are additive to defaults, environment overrides, the same table's `dirs`,
and `[[session_sources]]`. To scan only the listed homes, set `dirs = []` and
leave directory environment overrides and `session_sources` entries unset. Homes
must be local directories; use `dirs` for `s3://` roots on providers that
support S3. Sessions from each home appear under their native provider. Pi's
`homes` values correspond to `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, not its parent `.pi`
directory or a direct session directory.

Other providers support multiple explicit `dirs`; they do not yet accept
`homes`. A home mapping must match the provider's native layout before it can be
enabled.

At configuration load, local session roots become absolute paths with symbolic
links resolved. Duplicate roots are removed before scanning or watching starts.
Links to directories that do not exist yet retain their resolved destination, so
creating the directory later does not register a second scan root. Each home's
metadata paths remain separate from the shared transcript root.

The Session Providers section of the Settings page edits the same lists. Adding
or removing a home there updates `homes` in that provider's `[agents.<id>]`
table in `config.toml`. Like the provider enable toggles, the change takes
effect after the AgentsView daemon and any separate push-watch process restart.

![Codex alternate homes in Session Providers settings](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/settings-agent-homes.png)

#### Choosing a layout

There are two sensible ways to run a second home. Pick based on whether the
transcripts should be shared.

**Fully separate homes.** Each home owns its own transcripts. Use this when the
instances must not see each other's history, such as a personal and a work
account. Register every home and AgentsView scans each one:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex-work
CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-work codex login
```

```toml
[agents.codex]
homes = ["~/.codex-work"]
```

**Shared transcripts, separate profile.** The second home keeps its own
`config.toml`, skills, and per-instance metadata, but its session directories
are symbolic links into the primary home. Use this when you want different
settings or skill profiles while keeping one searchable history. This is the
recommended layout for profile switching, because nothing is copied and no
session exists in two places:

```bash
primary=~/.codex
alt=~/.codex-profile
mkdir -p "$alt"
ln -s "$primary/sessions" "$alt/sessions"
ln -s "$primary/archived_sessions" "$alt/archived_sessions"
ln -s "$primary/history.jsonl" "$alt/history.jsonl"
# leave config.toml, skills, session_index.jsonl, and the *.sqlite state files
# unlinked so the profile keeps its own settings and metadata
CODEX_HOME="$alt" codex
```

```toml
[agents.codex]
homes = ["~/.codex-profile"]
```

Codex writes thread titles to `session_index.jsonl` in whichever home the rename
happened in. Do not link that file; AgentsView reads every home's copy. HTTP
remote sync also transfers these indexes and preserves their associations with
the shared transcripts, so imported sessions retain titles from alternate homes.
When an index is removed or loses an entry, the next sync uses a title from the
remaining configured indexes. If none names the session, AgentsView keeps its
last known title. Deprecated SSH sync does not carry alternate-home index
associations. Upgrade both ends of HTTP sync together; older protocol versions
are rejected.

The same shape works for Claude Code by linking `<alt>/projects` to
`~/.claude/projects`. Claude keeps no title index, so there is nothing else to
leave unlinked for AgentsView's sake.

#### How links and duplicates are handled

- Roots that resolve to the same directory, including through symbolic links,
    are scanned once. Configuration loading stores the resolved absolute root
    and its provider metadata paths. A matching `[[session_sources]]` entry
    still supplies the machine key.
- Metadata belongs to the configured transcript root. If two homes share
    `sessions/` but keep separate `archived_sessions/`, their shared sessions
    read both homes' metadata; each archive reads only its own home's metadata.
- Codex sidecars are read from the effective root's home and from every alias
    home. Activity hints come from each distinct `history.jsonl`; a linked copy
    is read once. Thread titles concatenate every `session_index.jsonl`, and
    when two homes name the same session the most recently written index wins.
- Changing a title in an alias home is picked up live. Each home's directory is
    watched for `session_index.jsonl` changes and mapped back to the shared
    transcripts.
- A home whose link target does not exist yet is kept by its configured path and
    starts working once the target appears.

### Machine-Labeled Filesystem Sources

Use `[[session_sources]]` when a root was produced on another machine and
transported to this AgentsView host:

```toml
[[session_sources]]
agent = "copilot"
dir = "/srv/session-archive/buildbox/copilot"
machine = "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef" # Peer installation ID
```

The fields are `agent`, `dir`, and optional `machine`. Entries are additive to
the per-agent arrays, defaults, and environment variables above. Equivalent
roots are deduplicated; a structured entry supplies the machine key when it
duplicates a shorthand root. Use the peer's ID from `telemetry-install-id` for a
remote root. For a local root, omit `machine` to use this installation's ID. If
an existing local source sets `machine` to a hostname, remove that setting.
Source keys are used literally; filter aliases and display labels do not make a
source local.

Machine attribution is captured when each session is first ingested. Changing an
entry's `machine` value affects newly discovered sessions but does not relabel
existing sessions during ordinary syncs or `agentsview sync --full`. To adopt
old keys belonging to this installation, use
[`agentsview db adopt-machine`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-db-adopt-machine).

See [Filesystem Session Sync](/docs/filesystem-sync/) for multi-machine
examples, transport safety, ID deduplication, watcher behavior, and the
comparison with PostgreSQL.

### S3-Compatible Session Sources

Claude, Codex, Cursor, and IcodeMate session roots can also be `s3://` URIs.
These are the providers whose current formats can be discovered and parsed as
individual objects; future providers opt in through the same capability. This is
useful when several machines push their raw session files to object storage and
one central AgentsView instance reads them without SSH access to those machines.

```toml
[agents.claude]
dirs = [
  "~/.claude/projects",
  "s3://agent-archive/laptop/raw/claude",
]

[agents.codex]
dirs = [
  "~/.codex/sessions",
  "s3://agent-archive/laptop/raw/codex",
]

[agents.cursor]
dirs = [
  "~/.cursor/projects",
  "s3://agent-archive/laptop/raw/cursor",
]

[agents.icodemate]
dirs = [
  "~/.local/share/icodemate",
  "s3://agent-archive/laptop/raw/icodemate",
]
```

S3 sources are read-only inputs to the normal local sync. AgentsView lists
matching objects, fetches each changed object to a temporary file, parses it
with the existing per-agent parser, records the original `s3://` URI as
`file_path`, and removes the temporary file. No persistent local mirror is
created.

Credentials and endpoint configuration use standard AWS-style environment
variables:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.amazonaws.com
```

`AWS_S3_ENDPOINT` is optional for AWS S3. Set it for S3-compatible services such
as MinIO, Aliyun OSS, or Cloudflare R2. `http://` endpoints are accepted only
for loopback hosts such as `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. For a non-loopback HTTP
endpoint, set `AGENTSVIEW_ALLOW_INSECURE_S3_ENDPOINT=true`; use that override
only for trusted private networks because session transcripts travel without
TLS.

Expected object layouts:

```text
s3://bucket/.../<machine>/raw/claude/<project>/<uuid>.jsonl
s3://bucket/.../<machine>/raw/claude/<project>/subagents/.../agent-*.jsonl
s3://bucket/.../<machine>/raw/codex/2026/06/24/rollout-*.jsonl
s3://bucket/.../<machine>/raw/cursor/<project>/<uuid>.jsonl
s3://bucket/.../<machine>/raw/icodemate/<project>/<session>.jsonl
```

The machine name is derived from the path segment immediately before `raw`. If
no such segment exists, sessions use the local AgentsView machine label. Codex
discovery only imports rollout files under the configured root plus a trailing
slash, so sibling prefixes such as `raw/codex-backup` are ignored.

S3 object `Size`, `LastModified`, and available object fingerprints (`ETag`,
version ID, and checksum headers) are stored in the session row and used for
unchanged-object skip checks. A later sync therefore lists object metadata first
and downloads only objects whose source metadata changed or whose stored parser
data is stale.

S3 roots are not watched with fsnotify. They are picked up by initial sync,
manual sync, and the periodic directory scan.

### Worktree Project Mappings

The parser infers a session's project from its `cwd`. It recognizes common
worktree manager layouts, including the generic
`worktrees/github.com/<owner>/<repository>/<worktree>` convention, where the
repository segment becomes the project. Layouts it does not recognize — such as
`~/code/{project}.worktrees/feat/<branch>/` — otherwise group sessions under
`<branch>` rather than `{project}`. For those, register manual **path-prefix →
project** rules from the **Rules** view on the [Data page](/docs/data/#rules),
or let the [mapping editor](/docs/data/#create-a-project-mapping) create one
from a project's observed session folders:

![Worktree mapping rules on the Data page](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/worktree-mappings.png)

- Mappings are explicit; there is no auto-discovery.
- Each rule is scoped to one machine. The machine selector manages rules for the
    local machine and for any remotely synced machine. Rules live in the
    writable archive that ingests that machine's sessions, which may be the
    source machine's local SQLite archive or a separate collector archive.
- Each rule applies whenever a session's `cwd` falls under the configured
    prefix, on both new sessions as they sync and (via the **Apply** button)
    already-imported sessions. Prefixes match on directory boundaries, so
    `/worktrees/service` does not match `/worktrees/service-old`.
- Enabled mappings run after parser inference, so an explicit rule always wins
    when the two disagree.
- The default `explicit` layout maps every matching path to the project name
    stored on the rule. The `repo_dot_worktrees` layout derives the project from
    the first path segment under the prefix when it is named `<repo>.worktrees`,
    so a path like `/code/agentsview.worktrees/feature/frontend` resolves to
    project `agentsview`.
- Rules created from the Data mapping editor record the mislabeled project they
    corrected, shown as the rule's **original label**. The value is
    informational and set once; to manually revert a reclassification, edit the
    rule's target back to that original label and apply again.
- Disabling or deleting a rule does not rewrite sessions by itself. Sessions
    whose source files still exist revert to parser-derived names on a later
    reparse or full resync, while orphaned sessions keep their stored
    classification.
- Excluded, trashed, and skipped session files are left alone.

Mappings only mutate the session's `project` field; the rest of the session
record is preserved through the bulk-resync rebuild-and-copy path.

## Automated Session Detection

AgentsView classifies every `codex exec` run as automated, including runs with
multiple user messages. Roborev-tagged runs are classified as automated code
reviews. Other sessions are classified as automated when they have one or fewer
real user messages and their first user message matches the automation
classifier. Automated sessions (roborev reviews, title generation, warmup pings,
changelog generation, and similar scripted runs) are filtered out of session
lists, counts, and analytics by default — the **Include automated** toggle in
the session filter dropdown opts them back in.

A set of built-in patterns covers the roborev family and AgentsView's own
internal prompts. To teach AgentsView about first-message patterns unique to
your own automation, add them to `~/.agentsview/config.toml`:

```toml
[automated]
prefixes = [
  "You are summarizing a nightly batch run.",
  "INTERNAL-AUTOMATION:",
]
substrings = [
  "This is an automated repository maintenance run.",
]
exact_matches = [
  "Nightly automation completed.",
]
```

User-configured entries are case-sensitive and are matched against the session's
first user message:

| Key             | Match behavior                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `prefixes`      | `HasPrefix` against the first user message                   |
| `substrings`    | `Contains` anywhere in the first user message                |
| `exact_matches` | trims the first user message, then compares the whole string |

Entries are trimmed, deduplicated, and capped at 1024 characters. Entries that
duplicate a built-in pattern in the same category are silently dropped.

**Reclassification on config change.** AgentsView stores a hash of the active
classifier (built-in patterns + your configured patterns) with the database. On
startup, it rechecks stored `is_automated` values against the active classifier
and re-stamps the hash, so edits to `[automated]` patterns apply to history
immediately — no manual resync required. The same backfill also corrects rows
pulled in from PostgreSQL sync or copied from other archives.

## Database

The SQLite database uses WAL mode for concurrent reads and includes FTS5
full-text search indexes on message content.

### CJK full-text search

To add character and phrase matching for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text,
including Chinese word segmentation, build and install the pinned
`simple`/cppjieba sidecar with `make install-cjk-fts`. Building it requires Git,
CMake 3.19 or newer, and a C++14 compiler. AgentsView discovers it next to the
binary or under the sibling `lib/agentsview/simple` directory. A custom path can
be selected with `AGENTSVIEW_SIMPLE_DIR`.

The sidecar indexes individual CJK characters and routes queries containing Han,
Hiragana, Katakana, or Hangul through that index. Query preparation depends on
the scripts in the query:

- Queries containing Japanese kana or Korean Hangul preserve character order and
    adjacency within each whitespace-separated search term. For example, `かな`
    does not match `なか`, and `검색` does not match separate occurrences of `검` and
    `색`. Separate terms can match anywhere in the same message.
- Queries containing Han without kana or Hangul use Chinese word segmentation
    through cppjieba. Japanese queries written entirely in kanji take this same
    path because the scripts alone do not distinguish the languages. Quote a
    kanji phrase, such as `"検索方法"`, to require its characters in order.
- A leading double quote opts into explicit FTS5 expressions, including phrases
    and operators, in any language. For example, `"검색 기능"` requires the two
    terms together, while `검색 기능` allows intervening text.

Japanese and Korean matching is character-based; it does not analyze grammatical
word forms or expand readings, romanizations, or spelling variants. Chinese word
segmentation also stays off when a query mixes Han with kana or Hangul.

ASCII-only searches continue to use the existing Porter index, so searches such
as `run` retain English stemming. The `messages_cjk_fts` index is derived data:
if the sidecar is removed, AgentsView drops that optional index and continues
with the standard FTS5 path; reinstalling the sidecar backfills it on the next
writable open. AgentsView fingerprints the native library and all cppjieba
dictionaries, atomically rebuilding the index when that fingerprint changes.
Writers running with another fingerprint leave a freshness marker instead of
mixing incompatible token streams. Pinyin expansion is disabled in the derived
index because ASCII-only queries continue to use the Porter index.

CJK full-text search is specific to SQLite message search, including the HTTP,
CLI, and MCP search paths. PostgreSQL/CockroachDB and DuckDB do not load this
SQLite extension and keep their existing search behavior. Substring and
regular-expression searches are unchanged. Session search result snippets
highlight the segmented matches; highlighting inside an opened transcript uses
the original query and may miss separated Chinese words.

The first backfill, a changed fingerprint, or any pending session requires a
full index rebuild before startup completes. AgentsView logs this wait. The
freshness ledger stores session IDs rather than old message IDs and token
content, so it cannot remove stale entries for individual replaced or deleted
messages. Removing the sidecar drops the CJK index but retains the
`messages_cjk_fts_pending_sessions` ledger and three persistent session
triggers. The ledger holds at most one row per touched session ID until the next
successful CJK index rebuild clears it.

Index maintenance uses TEMP triggers on the writer connection. Writes made
without these triggers or with another sidecar fingerprint leave the index
stale. CJK search then falls back to standard FTS5 and logs a warning once per
database handle. Reopening the archive with the sidecar restores the index and
its triggers.

### Schema tables

| Table                | Purpose                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sessions`           | Session metadata (project, agent, timestamps, file info, user message count) |
| `messages`           | Message content with role, ordinal, timestamps                               |
| `tool_calls`         | Tool invocations with normalized category taxonomy                           |
| `tool_result_events` | Chronological status events for tool calls (e.g. Codex subagent updates)     |
| `insights`           | AI-generated session analysis and summaries                                  |
| `starred_sessions`   | Server-side star persistence (replaces localStorage)                         |
| `pinned_messages`    | Pinned message references with session linkage                               |
| `stats`              | Aggregate counts (session_count, message_count)                              |
| `skipped_files`      | Cache of non-interactive session files                                       |
| `source_failures`    | Cache of session files whose last parse failed                               |
| `messages_fts`       | FTS5 virtual table for full-text search                                      |
| `messages_cjk_fts`   | Optional CJK FTS5 index using the `simple` character tokenizer               |

The database is automatically migrated on startup when the schema changes. When
the stored data version is stale, AgentsView preserves the existing database and
runs a full resync into a fresh temporary database. The resync then copies
preserved/orphaned session data from the previous database before swapping
atomically. If the full resync aborts, AgentsView falls back to an incremental
sync and leaves the data-version marker stale so a later startup can retry the
full rewrite.

## Sync Behavior

AgentsView keeps the database in sync with session files through three
mechanisms:

1. **File watcher** — uses fsnotify to detect file changes. An isolated edit is
    batched for 500ms; watcher-driven sync start times remain at least five
    seconds apart. Common dependency and build folders (`node_modules`,
    `__pycache__`, `.git`, `vendor`, `dist`, etc.) are automatically skipped to
    reduce noise and overhead.
1. **Periodic sync** — full directory scan every 15 minutes as a safety net
1. **Codex live-activity hints** — every 30 seconds, the daemon checks the
    provider-declared `history.jsonl` append stream and file metadata for a
    bounded set of recently active rollouts. This is a freshness backstop for
    already indexed sessions, not a session source: normal discovery and sync
    still own ingestion, deletion, and canonical-path selection.

Change detection uses file size, mtime, inode, and device tracking to validate
incremental parses more reliably. A pool of 8 workers processes files in
parallel during sync.

Codex history hints are available when the producing frontend writes
`history.jsonl`. In Codex configuration, `[history] persistence = "none"`
disables those writes; frontends that do not produce history entries retain the
native watcher and periodic-sync freshness behavior. AgentsView reads only
session identity and timestamp metadata from accepted hint records and neither
stores nor logs submitted prompt text.

For each configured local Codex session root, AgentsView probes `history.jsonl`
in the cleaned root's parent. For example, a custom `/data/custom/sessions` root
probes `/data/custom/history.jsonl`. It does not search ancestors or the rollout
archive for another history file. Missing hint files remain cheap probes.

The initial daemon poll bootstraps at most the newest 4 MiB of each history file
and accepts records at most 24 hours old. If AgentsView restarts during a long
autonomous run whose last persisted prompt is outside either bound, that rollout
uses native-watcher freshness until another persisted prompt makes it hot again.

For `s3://` Claude, Codex, and Cursor roots, change detection uses object size,
`LastModified`, and available object fingerprints such as ETag, version ID, and
checksums from listing or stat calls. Object content is downloaded only after
that metadata shows a parse may be needed.

Files that produce no session, such as those with no interactive content, are
cached in the `skipped_files` table. Source files that are missing or whose
content is malformed are cached in the `source_failures` table, even when the
sync pass that found them did not complete. An unchanged cached failure counts
as a skip, allowing watcher retries to finish. Failure identities include the
provider's pre-parse fingerprint, including content hashes and companion files
where available. SQLite schema failures also track database and WAL changes, so
repairing a schema retries the source even if its session timestamps stay the
same. Missing files are retried when they appear. A full resync retries cached
failures so a parser upgrade can reach a source that never produced a session.
If that rebuild is discarded, the incremental catch-up still retries them.
Failures that can clear up on their own, such as a timeout or a permission error,
are not cached and are retried on every pass.

Sync summaries include a `Parser anomalies (this run)` section whenever the
current run observes parser or sanitizer anomalies. The section can include
malformed-line counts, unrecognized Antigravity schema sessions, sanitized-field
counts, and Antigravity `gen_metadata without usage` counts. A
`gen_metadata without usage` entry means Antigravity supplied generation
metadata for one or more records, but AgentsView could not derive normalized
usage totals from those records during that sync.

When a data-version resync runs, startup output prints durable phase and
completion lines for the resync steps. Background daemons also publish startup
state while they hold the start lock, so `agentsview daemon status` can show the
starting PID, elapsed time, current phase, progress detail, and log path before
the HTTP server is ready.

### Restricting Ingestion by Working Directory

By default every discovered session is ingested. To limit the archive to
sessions from specific workspaces — for example on a machine shared across
multiple clients where transcripts from one workspace should never appear
alongside another — set `sync_include_cwd_prefixes` in
`~/.agentsview/config.toml`:

```toml
sync_include_cwd_prefixes = [
  "/home/me/work/client-a",
  "/home/me/oss",
]
```

When the list is non-empty, a session is ingested only if its recorded working
directory equals one of the prefixes or lives underneath one. Prefixes and
session directories are lexically cleaned before matching: trailing separators
are ignored and `..` components are resolved, so `/home/me/oss/../other` does
not match a `/home/me/oss` prefix. Matching is path-boundary aware
(`/home/me/oss` matches `/home/me/oss/repo` but not `/home/me/oss-other`),
case-sensitive, and uses the local operating system's path separator — on Linux
and macOS a backslash is an ordinary filename character, not a directory
boundary. Use absolute paths; `~` is not expanded.

Notes:

- Sessions without a recorded working directory (a few agents do not store one)
    are skipped while the filter is set.
- The filter gates ingestion only. Sessions already in the archive are preserved
    (the SQLite database is a persistent archive); remove unwanted existing
    sessions explicitly with `agentsview prune`.
- Remote-host sync is unaffected: the prefixes describe local paths, so they are
    not applied to sessions pulled from `[[remote_hosts]]` entries.

### macOS Protected Folders

To label a session with its Git remote, worktree, and branch, AgentsView reads
Git metadata from the session's recorded working directory. On macOS some
locations are guarded by a privacy consent prompt, and reading inside one makes
macOS attribute the request to the AgentsView app and ask the user for access.
Because the first sync walks every session in the archive at once, this produced
a burst of prompts at first launch for folders the user never pointed AgentsView
at.

AgentsView no longer touches these locations during discovery:

- `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents`, `~/Downloads`, `~/Movies`, `~/Music`, `~/Pictures`
- `~/Library/CloudStorage` (Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box) and
    `~/Dropbox`
- `~/Library/Mobile Documents` (iCloud Drive)

Sessions whose working directory lives in one of these folders — including
directories that only reach one through a symlink — keep **path-only project
identity**: they are still ingested, listed, searched, and grouped by path, but
they carry no Git remote, worktree relationship, or branch, and their project
name comes from the path rather than the enclosing Git repository. Sessions
anywhere else are unaffected.

If you keep code in one of these folders and want the Git detail, opt in:

```toml
scan_protected_paths = true
```

macOS then prompts once per folder on the next sync; granting access restores
full identity for those sessions, and denying leaves them path-only. The option
has no effect on other platforms.

Enabling the option applies to sessions parsed after the change. Sessions
already in the archive keep their path-only identity until their session files
change; run `agentsview sync --full` to reparse the archive and pick up Git
detail for existing sessions.

### Large Watch Trees

The recursive watcher has a hard budget of 8192 directories per process. If a
session root is larger than the remaining budget, or if registering watches hits
the operating system's inotify or file-descriptor limit (`ENOSPC` / `EMFILE`),
as of 0.27.0 AgentsView **degrades** that root to polling instead of aborting
startup. The HTTP listener is now bound before any watches are registered, so
the server still comes up cleanly.

Roots that fall back to polling are picked up by:

- the existing 15-minute periodic full sync, plus
- a new 2-minute fallback sync loop that runs whenever any roots are unwatched
    (it re-syncs all configured roots, not just the unwatched ones)

Startup logs make degradation explicit. Per-root and summary lines look like:

```
Couldn't watch 12500 directories under /home/me/.claude/projects, will poll every 2m0s
Polling 1 roots every 2m0s for changes
```

No configuration is required, but on Linux you can still raise the global cap to
keep more roots watched in real time:

```bash
sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
```

## Memory Behavior

The serve daemon bounds its own memory, so no tuning is required. It installs a
256 MiB Go soft memory limit, and on Linux it also limits glibc to two malloc
arenas and pins the heap trim threshold at 1 MiB. Pinning the threshold turns
off glibc's dynamic adjustment, which otherwise lets a long-running process stop
trimming until as much as 64 MiB is free, so memory freed by the SQLite driver
goes back to the operating system instead of accumulating as fragmentation.
Setting `GOMEMLIMIT`, `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX`, or `MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_` in the
daemon's environment overrides the corresponding default.

## Manual Sync

Trigger a sync from the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/sync
```

Trigger a full resync (re-parses all session files from scratch):

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/resync
```

Both endpoints stream progress via Server-Sent Events when accessed from a
browser or SSE-capable client.

Check sync status:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/sync/status
```

## Privacy and Telemetry

By default, all session data stays on your local machine in SQLite. Normal
browsing, search, and reports do not send session content, project names,
prompts, file paths, or hostnames anywhere.

Optional features that send data externally when you enable them:

- [Hosted Raw Sync](/docs/hosted-raw-sync/) sends original provider files to a
    hosted custody service configured by your deployment operator.
- [PostgreSQL sync](/docs/pg-sync/) (`pg push`) sends session data to a
  PostgreSQL database you configure.
- [ClickHouse sync](/docs/clickhouse-sync/) (`clickhouse push`) sends session
  data to a ClickHouse database you configure.
- The [DuckDB mirror](/docs/duckdb/) writes a local DuckDB file by default; data
    only leaves the machine if you expose the mirror over a remote Quack
    endpoint.
- [Generated insights](/docs/recall/#current-surface) sends scoped session
    content to the configured endpoint when `[insights]` is set, or to the
    selected agent CLI when it is absent.
- [Publish to Gist](/docs/usage/#publish-to-gist) uploads a session to GitHub.

The automatic outbound requests are update checks and an anonymous daemon ping:

- **CLI and web UI** — on startup, the server contacts the GitHub API to check
    for new releases. No identifying information is sent beyond what a standard
    GitHub API request includes (IP address, user-agent).
- **Desktop app** — uses Tauri's native updater, which checks the GitHub release
    feed independently.
- **Anonymous daemon telemetry** — see below.

### Anonymous Daemon Telemetry

As of 0.33.0, the server sends an anonymous `daemon_active` liveness ping on
startup and every 24 hours while running. The ping contains only:

- app version and git commit
- operating system and CPU architecture
- the application-owned installation ID stored in
    `~/.agentsview/telemetry-install-id`

It contains no session data, prompts, project names, file paths, account
information, or hostname, and the events are sent with person-profile processing
and GeoIP lookup disabled. The ping runs in the background and never blocks
startup or operation.

Disable it with an environment variable:

```bash
export AGENTSVIEW_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0
```

This disables outbound telemetry, not the installation identity used for local
session attribution.

### Disabling Update Checks

Disable the CLI/web UI update check with any of:

| Method               | Value                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Config file          | `disable_update_check = true` in `~/.agentsview/config.toml` |
| Environment variable | `AGENTSVIEW_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK=1`                          |
| CLI flag             | `--no-update-check`                                          |

The desktop app's auto-updater is controlled separately via
`AGENTSVIEW_DESKTOP_AUTOUPDATE=0`.

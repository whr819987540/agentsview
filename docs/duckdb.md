title: DuckDB Mirror
description: Mirror the local SQLite archive into DuckDB and serve it locally or over the Quack remote protocol
---

As of 0.33.0, AgentsView can mirror its local SQLite archive into a DuckDB
database and serve the read-only web UI from that mirror — either from the local
file or remotely over DuckDB's Quack protocol. SQLite remains the source of
truth for ingestion; the mirror is populated by `duckdb push` or
`duckdb push --watch`, the same one-way model as [PostgreSQL sync](/docs/pg-sync/).

This is useful when you want a portable single-file analytics copy of your
archive, or want to query your sessions with DuckDB directly, without standing
up a PostgreSQL server.

!!! warning "Experimental"
    The DuckDB backend is new in 0.33.0, and Quack is a beta DuckDB
    core extension. Expect rough edges, and treat the Quack remote
    path as suitable for trusted networks only.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Mirror local SQLite into ~/.agentsview/sessions.duckdb
agentsview duckdb push

# Check mirror state
agentsview duckdb status

# Serve the read-only web UI from the mirror
agentsview duckdb serve

# Keep the mirror current in the foreground
agentsview duckdb push --watch
```

`duckdb push` accepts the same project-filter and foreground watcher flags as
[`pg push`](/docs/pg-sync/#project-filtering):

| Flag                 | Default | Description                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--full`             | `false` | Force full local resync and DuckDB push                        |
| `--projects`         |         | Comma-separated projects to push (inclusive)                   |
| `--exclude-projects` |         | Comma-separated projects to exclude from push                  |
| `--all-projects`     | `false` | Ignore configured project filters for this run                 |
| `--watch`            | `false` | Run continuously, pushing on change plus a periodic floor      |
| `--debounce`         | `30s`   | Coalesce window after a change before pushing (`--watch` only) |
| `--interval`         | `15m`   | Periodic floor push interval (`--watch` only)                  |

With `--watch`, AgentsView performs one initial sync and DuckDB push, then keeps
running until interrupted. Shutdown via `Ctrl+C` or `SIGTERM` cancels the
watcher cleanly.

`duckdb push` always writes the local mirror file at `[duckdb].path`; it never
pushes to a remote Quack endpoint. If `[duckdb].url` or
`AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_URL` is configured, push fails immediately with an error
telling you to unset it for pushes and expose the mirror remotely with
`agentsview duckdb quack serve` instead. `url` is read-side only, configuring
`duckdb status` and `duckdb serve`; `token` and `allow_insecure` also
configure `duckdb quack serve`.

When `[duckdb].path` or `AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_PATH` is configured, all local
DuckDB commands use that same mirror file by default, including
`duckdb quack serve`. Use `duckdb quack serve --path ...` only when you want to
expose a different mirror than the one used by `duckdb push`, `duckdb status`,
and `duckdb serve`.

`duckdb serve` accepts the same serve flags as
[`pg serve`](/docs/pg-sync/#agentsview-pg-serve) (`--host`, `--port`, `--base-path`,
proxy and TLS flags) and is read-only in the same way — no uploads, file
watching, or local sync.

## Quack Remote Access

[Quack](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/core_extensions/quack) is DuckDB's
remote-access extension: it turns a DuckDB instance into a server that other
DuckDB clients can attach to over `quack:` URIs. AgentsView uses it to serve the
web UI on one machine from a mirror that lives on another:

```bash
# Machine A: expose the local mirror over loopback Quack
agentsview duckdb quack serve \
  --bind quack:127.0.0.1:9494 \
  --token "$AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_TOKEN"

# Machine B (or another terminal): serve the UI from that endpoint
AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_URL='quack:127.0.0.1:9494' \
AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_TOKEN="$AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_TOKEN" \
agentsview duckdb serve
```

The client `url` uses the native `quack:HOST:PORT` form. The Quack extension
attaches only that authority form; URL-scheme forms such as
`quack:http://HOST:PORT` are rejected at attach time, so AgentsView refuses them
up front. A non-loopback client host requires `allow_insecure` (Quack speaks
plain HTTP — put it behind TLS, a VPN, or an SSH tunnel first).

`duckdb push` never targets a remote endpoint, even when `[duckdb].url` is
set: run push on the machine where the mirror file lives, then use
`duckdb quack serve` to expose that file to other machines, which read it
through `duckdb status` or `duckdb serve` pointed at the Quack URL.

`duckdb quack serve` flags:

| Flag               | Default                      | Description                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `--bind`           | `quack:127.0.0.1:9494`       | Quack bind URI             |
| `--path`           | `[duckdb].path`              | DuckDB mirror file to expose |
| `--token`          | (required unless configured) | Quack authentication token |
| `--allow-insecure` | `false`                      | Allow binding beyond loopback |

Safety defaults:

- The Quack listener binds to loopback (`127.0.0.1`) by default.
- A token is required from `--token`, `AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_TOKEN`, or
  `[duckdb].token`; the token value is never printed.
- Binding to a non-loopback address requires the explicit
  `--allow-insecure` flag. Quack speaks plain HTTP, so put it
  behind TLS, a VPN, or an SSH tunnel before exposing it beyond
  the local machine.

## Machine Identity and Upgrades

The mirror retains each session's installation ID and copies its display label
and adopted hostname aliases. Set `local_machine_name` in `config.toml`, restart
the daemon, and push again to update the displayed name.

The [installation upgrade](/docs/configuration/#upgrading-historical-machine-keys)
changes the default mirror machine key from a hostname to an installation ID.
The next `duckdb push` rebuilds the mirror once for that change; SQLite history
stays intact.

## Configuration

DuckDB settings live in a `[duckdb]` section of `~/.agentsview/config.toml`:

```toml
local_machine_name = "Laptop"

[duckdb]
path = "~/.agentsview/sessions.duckdb"
url = "quack:127.0.0.1:9494"
token = "..."
allow_insecure = false
attach_timeout = "20s"
projects = ["alpha", "beta"]
# or: exclude_projects = ["scratch"]
```

| Field              | Default                         | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path`             | `~/.agentsview/sessions.duckdb` | Local DuckDB mirror file                                                                    |
| `url`              |                                 | Remote Quack endpoint for `duckdb status` and `duckdb serve` (`quack:` URI); read side only — `duckdb push` rejects it |
| `token`            |                                 | Quack authentication token                                                                  |
| `machine_name`     | Installation ID                 | Explicit machine key for legacy local-sentinel rows; new sessions retain their recorded installation ID                |
| `allow_insecure`   | `false`                         | Allow plain-HTTP Quack beyond loopback                                                      |
| `attach_timeout`   | `20s`                           | Bound on a remote Quack `ATTACH` (and its TCP preflight); `0` uses the default, a negative value disables the guard |
| `projects`         |                                 | Array of project names to include in push                                                   |
| `exclude_projects` |                                 | Array of project names to exclude from push                                                 |

When a remote Quack `url` is configured, `duckdb status` and `duckdb serve`
first make a bounded TCP dial to the endpoint and then run the `ATTACH` under a
watchdog, so an unreachable or unresponsive server fails fast with a clear
error instead of hanging indefinitely. Because the `ATTACH` executes inside
the DuckDB extension (CGO, which Go cannot interrupt), a timed-out attach may
leak the underlying connection until the process exits; the command still
returns promptly.

Environment variables override the config file:

| Variable                           | Description                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_PATH`           | Local DuckDB mirror file path |
| `AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_URL`            | Remote Quack endpoint URL for status and serve (read side only) |
| `AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_TOKEN`          | Quack authentication token    |
| `AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_MACHINE`        | Machine name override         |
| `AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_ATTACH_TIMEOUT` | Remote attach timeout (Go duration, e.g. `20s`; `0` default, negative disables) |

## Limitations

- **One-way mirror** — data flows from SQLite to DuckDB only, via `duckdb push`
  or the foreground `duckdb push --watch` process. DuckDB and Quack are read
  backends; they do not ingest session files directly.
- **Search is unindexed** — DuckDB-backed search uses substring/regex matching
  rather than the FTS5 index that local SQLite serving uses, so content search
  is slower on large archives.
- **No Windows ARM64 support** — the upstream `duckdb-go-bindings` ship no
  prebuilt DuckDB library for `windows/arm64`, so `agentsview duckdb`
  subcommands report a clear error on that platform. Everything SQLite-backed
  works normally. On all other platforms the DuckDB driver is linked into the
  standard binary (which grows it considerably — this is expected).
- **The mirror is a disposable derived artifact** — `duckdb push` rebuilds it
  from scratch (temp file, atomic swap) when the file is missing or damaged,
  `--full` is passed, the mirror's schema version does not match the running
  binary, the local SQLite data version has changed (for example after a
  resync), the mirror was built from a different SQLite archive than the one
  pushing now, or the project-filter scope has changed. Otherwise push
  applies a bounded incremental update that replaces only changed sessions,
  applies recorded deletions, and removes previously mirrored sessions whose
  project has since moved out of the configured scope.
- **The first push after a resync is always a full rebuild** — the mirror
  records the `database_id` of the SQLite archive generation it was built
  from, and a resync builds a fresh archive with a new `database_id`. A push
  whose local archive id no longer matches the mirror's recorded id rebuilds
  from scratch instead of applying an incremental update whose cutoff and
  journal cursors describe a different archive's history. This parallels the
  PostgreSQL push, whose sync cursors are scoped by `database_id` in the
  same way.
- **Scope changes rebuild the mirror** — `--projects` / `--exclude-projects`
  (or the configured `projects` / `exclude_projects`) scope is a property of
  the whole mirror file. Changing it rebuilds the mirror to contain exactly
  the new scope; sessions that were in scope for an earlier push are no
  longer preserved once they fall out of scope. With an unchanged scope, a
  session whose own project reassignment moves it out of scope is removed
  from the mirror by the next incremental push, including when it was
  hard-deleted locally after the move.
- **Generated artifacts live in a per-mirror work directory** — push and
  serve keep everything they generate (rebuild temp files, the hardlink
  aliases serve uses to reopen a replaced mirror) in a private directory
  next to the mirror named `<mirror-path>.agentsview-work`. Stale-artifact
  cleanup only ever deletes inside that directory, so your own files next
  to the mirror are never touched, whatever they are named. The directory
  is safe to delete whenever no `duckdb push`, `duckdb serve`, or
  `duckdb quack serve` process is running; the next push or serve recreates
  it as needed. The directory must be private: it is created
  user-only-writable, and push/serve refuse a work directory that is a
  symlink, owned by another user, or writable by group or other (delete or
  `chmod go-w` it and retry).
- **`duckdb serve` and `duckdb quack serve` never create or migrate the
  mirror** — a missing or schema-incompatible file makes them exit with an
  error to run `duckdb push --full`. Both detect when a later push replaces
  the file and reopen automatically: `duckdb serve` keeps serving the old
  data until a compatible replacement appears, while `duckdb quack serve`
  stops serving during the switch and, if the replacement is incompatible,
  stays down (retrying with backoff) until a good file shows up. Run pushes
  before or between serve sessions when that timing matters.
- **Serve holds the mirror read-only; pushes probe freely** — `duckdb
  serve` and `duckdb quack serve` open the mirror with DuckDB's read-only
  access mode, and read-only handles coexist across processes. A push can
  therefore always inspect a served mirror; only DuckDB's exclusive WRITE
  lock conflicts. While serve processes hold the file, an incremental
  push cannot acquire write access: an explicit `duckdb push` falls back
  to a full rebuild (temp file plus atomic rename, which never opens the
  destination for writing), while the automatic pushes of `duckdb push
  --watch` defer instead (logging the deferral) so a long-running serve
  does not turn every changed batch into a full-archive rebuild. A
  deferred push does not advance the mirror's push cutoff, so once the
  serve process releases the file the next push catches up on everything
  that changed in the meantime. A push that finds the mirror held
  READ-WRITE fails with an error naming the holder: that is either
  another push in flight or a serve process built before serve went
  read-only — upgrading such a serve process needs a one-time restart.
  Leftover `<mirror-path>.agentsview-mirror` sidecar files from older
  development builds are inert and can be deleted. On POSIX platforms,
  where rename is atomic even against an open destination handle, a
  running serve process picks up a rebuilt file automatically (see the
  reopen behavior above) without needing a restart. On Windows, the serve
  process's open handle on the destination file can block the rename
  outright; `duckdb push` retries briefly and then fails with an error
  asking you to stop the serving process and re-run the push.

title: Semantic Search
description: Vector (semantic) search over session messages, plus hybrid search and cursor-based context retrieval
---

AgentsView can index user and assistant message content into a local vector
store and search it by meaning instead of exact terms, alongside the existing
substring/regex/FTS5 content search. This is an opt-in feature backed by an
OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint — a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
model or a hosted API.

For the architecture behind this page — storage layout, generations,
concurrency, and the search path — see
[Semantic Search Internals](/docs/semantic-search-internals/).

!!! note "Backends"

    Semantic and hybrid search run on the local SQLite archive and on
    [PostgreSQL](#postgresql) via pgvector. The [DuckDB mirror](/docs/duckdb/) has
    no vector backend, so `--semantic`/`--hybrid` against a DuckDB-backed server
    return the "not available" error described below.

## Enabling `[vector]`

Semantic search is disabled by default. Add a `[vector]` section to
`~/.agentsview/config.toml`:

```toml
[vector]
enabled = true                    # default false; everything below is opt-in
# db_path defaults to <data_dir>/vectors.db
include_automated = false         # default; automated sessions (e.g. roborev) are not embedded -- set true to include

[vector.embeddings]
model = "nomic-embed-text"
dimension = 768                   # every returned vector must have this length
max_input_chars = 8192            # per-chunk rune cap (default 8192)
model_context_tokens = 32000      # optional model context used to cap build request size
query_prefix = "search_query: "    # prepended only to search queries
document_prefix = "search_document: " # prepended only to indexed document chunks
# request_dimensions = true      # ask for Matryoshka-reduced vectors of exactly `dimension` (see below)
# input_suffix = "<|endoftext|>"  # appended to every embedded text; default empty (see below)
default_server = "local"          # server used for query encoding and unnamed builds

[vector.embeddings.servers.local]
endpoint = "http://localhost:11434/v1"  # OpenAI-compatible base URL; "/embeddings" is appended
api_key_env = "OPENAI_API_KEY"    # name of an env var holding the key; omit for anonymous access
batch_size = 32                   # inputs per HTTP call (default 32)
max_batch_tokens = 120000         # optional provider cap across all inputs in one call
concurrency = 4                   # documents embedded in parallel during a build (default 4)
timeout = "30s"                   # per-HTTP-call timeout (default "30s")
max_retries = 3                   # attempts on 5xx/network errors; 4xx fails fast (default 3)
                                   # document builds retry a 429 until it clears (or the daemon
                                   # shuts down) instead of spending this budget on it; query
                                   # encoders still count it here
# ollama_cpu_fallback = true      # Ollama only: retry invalid Metal vectors once on CPU

[vector.embed]
run_after_sync = true             # daemon embeds deltas after each sync, debounced ~30s (default true)
recall = false                    # default; set true to permit automatic Recall embedding
backstop_interval = "24h"         # periodic full reconciliation scan; negative disables (default "24h")
```

`model`, `dimension`, and at least one `[vector.embeddings.servers.<name>]`
entry with an `endpoint` are required once `enabled = true`; `agentsview` fails
fast with an actionable message if any is missing or a duration field doesn't
parse. Restart the daemon (or run a CLI command) after editing the file.

Automatic Recall embedding has a separate, default-off consent gate. Setting
`[vector.embed] recall = true` permits daemon startup, corpus mutations, and
periodic backstops to send accepted Recall entry titles, bodies, and triggers to
the configured embeddings endpoint. `run_after_sync` controls only session
archive sync notifications; it does not suppress Recall startup or Recall
corpus-mutation refreshes after that consent is enabled. A manual
`agentsview embeddings build --store recall` remains available without this
setting because invoking that command is an explicit one-time request. Recall
vector and hybrid queries also fail closed as unavailable whenever the served
Recall corpus is newer than the last completed build; lexical queries remain
available while an automatic or manual refresh catches up.

### Named embeddings servers

Model identity — `model`, `dimension`, `request_dimensions`, `max_input_chars`,
`query_prefix`, `document_prefix`, and `input_suffix` — is global: every server
in the `servers` table must serve that same model and input recipe, so vectors
produced by any of them are interchangeable and land in the same generation.
What varies per server is transport and capacity: `endpoint`, `api_key_env`,
`timeout`, `max_retries`, `batch_size`, `max_batch_tokens`, `concurrency`, and
`ollama_cpu_fallback`.

When `model_context_tokens` and a server's `max_batch_tokens` are both set,
builds cap that server's effective batch size at
`floor(max_batch_tokens / model_context_tokens)`. AgentsView conservatively
charges every input the full model context because providers may truncate each
oversized input to exactly that length before enforcing their aggregate request
cap. For example, a 32,000-token context and a 120,000-token request cap reduce
`batch_size = 4` to three inputs per call (96,000 worst-case tokens), preventing
the 128,000-token request that four truncated inputs could produce.

`max_batch_tokens` must be at least `model_context_tokens`, and setting it
requires `model_context_tokens`. Both default to zero (disabled), so existing
server configurations retain their document-count batching until their model and
provider limits are declared. These settings only shape build and repair
requests; they do not alter input text or the vector-generation fingerprint.

Any `agentsview` command that loads the config, including `sync` and
`embeddings build`, fails if `[vector]` or its subtables contain an unknown key.
This check also applies when vector search is disabled, so a misspelled
`enabled` key cannot silently leave it off. The error names the key. For a
per-server key written in the parent `[vector.embeddings]` table, it also names
`[vector.embeddings.servers.<name>]` as the table that owns it. Fix or remove
the key before running the command again.

This split exists so you can encode search queries against a fast local server
while offloading bulk index builds to a bigger remote machine:

```toml
[vector.embeddings]
model = "qwen3-embedding-4b"
dimension = 2560
input_suffix = "<|endoftext|>"
default_server = "local"

[vector.embeddings.servers.local]      # laptop llama.cpp: low latency for queries
endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:30000/v1"

[vector.embeddings.servers.build-box]  # remote GPU box: high throughput for builds
endpoint = "http://build-box:30000/v1"
timeout = "300s"
concurrency = 6
```

`default_server` names the server used for search-time query encoding and for
any build that doesn't select one; with a single server defined it is implicit,
with more than one it is required.
`agentsview embeddings build --using build-box` runs one build against a
different server without touching the default. Because the model identity is
global, the server choice is not part of the generation fingerprint — a build
started on one server can be topped up incrementally from another.
`ollama_cpu_fallback` is also transport-only: enabling or disabling it does not
change the generation fingerprint or rebuild the index.

One caveat: the same model served at different quantizations (say F16 on one
box, Q8 on another) produces slightly different vectors for the same text. They
live in the same embedding space and search still works, but for bit-identical
vectors serve the same weights everywhere.

`concurrency` bounds how many documents a build embeds in parallel. Builds are
usually round-trip-bound rather than compute-bound — especially against a remote
endpoint — so a few requests in flight at once multiply throughput. Servers that
process one request at a time simply queue the extras; raise the value if your
endpoint has spare parallel capacity, or set it to 1 to send one request at a
time. Responses are requested in the compact base64 encoding automatically (with
a transparent fallback for servers that reject or ignore `encoding_format`),
which cuts response transfer roughly 4x on slow links.

### Role-aware task prefixes

Some embedding models are trained with different input instructions for search
queries and indexed documents. `query_prefix` is prepended only when AgentsView
embeds a search query; `document_prefix` is prepended to every document chunk
during manual, scheduled, and repair builds. Both default to empty, preserving
the input bytes and generation fingerprints produced by older configurations.

EmbeddingGemma's ordinary retrieval recipe without document titles is:

```toml
[vector.embeddings]
model = "embeddinggemma"
dimension = 768
query_prefix = "task: search result | query: "
document_prefix = "title: none | text: "
```

Nomic uses `search_query: ` and `search_document: `, as shown in the initial
configuration example. E5 models commonly use `query: ` and `passage: `. Models
such as Qwen3-Embedding that recommend an instruction only for queries can leave
`document_prefix` unset.

Prefixes are applied after document content is chunked, so `max_input_chars`
limits the original chunk rather than the final affixed request. If the
embedding endpoint has a strict context limit, leave enough headroom for the
configured prefix and suffix. When an endpoint explicitly rejects an input for
exceeding its token or context limit, AgentsView logs the rejection and
skip-stamps that document for the generation so one oversized input cannot block
the rest of the archive. Lower `max_input_chars` and rebuild to include it.

Both prefixes are part of the generation fingerprint. Adding, removing, or
changing either one creates a new generation and re-embeds the archive on the
next build. This intentionally treats the query/document recipe as one
reproducible embedding configuration, even though changing only `query_prefix`
would not alter stored document vectors.

`input_suffix` is appended verbatim to every text sent to the endpoint —
documents at build time and queries at search time — for models that expect a
terminator the serving layer does not add. The main example is Qwen3-Embedding
served by llama.cpp, which is benchmarked with `<|endoftext|>` appended to each
input. The suffix is part of the generation fingerprint, so changing it
(including setting it for the first time) re-embeds the whole archive on the
next build.

### Reduced output dimensions (Matryoshka)

Matryoshka-trained embedding models — Qwen3-Embedding, OpenAI's
`text-embedding-3-*` — can serve shorter vectors than their native output by
truncating and renormalizing server-side, trading a little recall for a smaller,
faster index. By default agentsview never asks for this: `dimension` only
validates that responses have the expected length, and nothing extra goes on the
wire. Setting `request_dimensions = true` sends `dimension` as the
OpenAI-compatible `dimensions` request field on every embeddings call — document
builds and search-query encoding alike, so both always use the same requested
length:

```toml
[vector]
enabled = true

[vector.embeddings]
model = "qwen3-embedding:0.6b"
dimension = 256                 # reduced from the model's native 1024
request_dimensions = true

[vector.embeddings.servers.local]
endpoint = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
```

```bash
# Qwen3-Embedding supports Matryoshka reduction; Ollama's OpenAI-compatible
# /v1/embeddings route passes the dimensions field through to it.
ollama pull qwen3-embedding:0.6b
```

This requires an endpoint and model that support dimension selection. Reduction
is never faked client-side: an endpoint that rejects the `dimensions` field
fails the build or query with an error naming `request_dimensions` and the fix,
and one that silently ignores the field and returns native-length vectors fails
the dimension check with the same guidance, rather than agentsview truncating
vectors itself. Endpoints that don't support the field keep working as long as
`request_dimensions` stays unset.

`request_dimensions` is part of the generation fingerprint (like `input_suffix`,
only when enabled): reduced vectors are renormalized prefixes, not
byte-identical to native output, so enabling it — or changing `dimension` —
makes the existing index stale and re-embeds the archive on the next build.

The first scheduled build that `run_after_sync` triggers after enabling
`[vector]` embeds the entire existing archive, not just deltas, since the mirror
starts out empty and every document counts as pending. For a hosted embeddings
API that is a real cost event, so run `agentsview embeddings build` directly at
a time of your choosing if you want to control when that initial cost lands,
rather than letting the debounced after-sync scheduler trigger it on its own.
The same cost event can recur on upgrade: when a new agentsview version changes
the index's internal mirror schema or document-identity scheme, the next
writable open resets the mirror, and with `run_after_sync = true` the next sync
automatically re-embeds the entire archive against the configured endpoint.

By default, `include_automated = false` keeps automated sessions (e.g. roborev)
out of the embedding index entirely, mirroring session search's default
exclusion of those sessions from results. This matters most for a large archive
dominated by automated sessions: embedding content that search already hides by
default just adds embedding API cost and dilutes semantic ranking with results
nobody is searching for. Because a session that was never embedded has no vector
to match, `session search --semantic --include-automated` still returns no
semantic hits for automated sessions unless the index was built with
`include_automated = true` (or a one-off `embeddings build --include-automated`,
see below). Changing `include_automated` between builds — in config or via the
flag — triggers a full mirror reconciliation on the next build: it removes
now-out-of-scope rows (and their vectors) or picks up newly-in-scope sessions,
without re-embedding documents that were already in scope and unchanged.

### Ollama quickstart

```bash
# Pull an embeddings model once.
ollama pull nomic-embed-text

# Ollama serves an OpenAI-compatible endpoint at /v1; no API key needed.
```

```toml
[vector]
enabled = true

[vector.embeddings]
model = "nomic-embed-text"
dimension = 768

[vector.embeddings.servers.local]
endpoint = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
ollama_cpu_fallback = true
```

The encoder POSTs to `<endpoint>/embeddings` with an OpenAI-style
`{"model": ..., "input": [...]}` body and expects
`{"data": [{"index": 0, "embedding": [...]}]}` back — this matches Ollama's
`/v1/embeddings` route as well as OpenAI and most self-hosted OpenAI-compatible
servers. A response whose embedding length doesn't match `dimension` is
rejected. AgentsView also rejects non-finite components (`NaN` or infinity),
JSON `null` components, and zero-norm vectors before they can be written to the
index. Those failures are retried according to `max_retries`; if every attempt
is invalid, the build stops and leaves the document pending.

For Ollama on Apple Metal, `ollama_cpu_fallback = true` adds one explicit
recovery attempt after those normal retries are exhausted. AgentsView keeps the
valid vectors from the final Metal response and sends only the invalid inputs to
Ollama's native `/api/embed` route with `options.num_gpu = 0`,
`truncate = false`, and `keep_alive = "0s"`. This requests a CPU-only runner and
asks Ollama to unload it immediately after the response. The configured endpoint
must be an absolute HTTP(S) URL ending in `/v1`, from which AgentsView derives
the native route while preserving proxy prefixes and query parameters.

Each CPU recovery can incur model-load and CPU-inference latency, followed by
another model load for the next Metal request. AgentsView gates primary and
fallback traffic only among fallback-enabled encoders whose derived native URL
matches exactly. The process-local gate does not cover fallback-disabled server
entries, differently spelled aliases or query strings, or external Ollama
clients; reserve the endpoint for AgentsView during fallback, or configure every
AgentsView entry for that Ollama instance with the same endpoint and opt-in.
Canceled requests leave the gate queue promptly.

With Ollama 0.32.7 during diagnosis, the CPU request was observed to replace the
Metal runner, unload after its response, and cause the next request to load a
fresh Metal runner. That sequence is observed behavior, not an Ollama scheduler
guarantee, and AgentsView does not attempt to verify Ollama's internal runner
lifecycle. The setting is therefore intended as automatic recovery for rare
invalid output, not as a permanent CPU serving mode.

### Direct `llama-server` for high-throughput Ollama models

Ollama's normal `/v1/embeddings` route above is the supported, simplest setup.
Operators who run the `llama-server` binary bundled with Ollama directly to get
explicit slot and batch controls should disable its prompt-state cache for a
dedicated embedding service:

```bash
llama-server \
  --model /path/to/embedding-model.gguf \
  --alias my-embedding-model \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 11435 \
  --embedding --parallel 4 \
  --batch-size 8192 --ubatch-size 8192 \
  --cache-ram 0 --no-cache-prompt --no-cache-idle-slots \
  --slot-prompt-similarity 0
```

These are `llama-server` command-line flags, not `ollama serve` environment
variables. Its prompt cache stores reusable inference state rather than a final
embedding API result, so disabling it can still be useful for a dedicated
embedding service that does not benefit from conversational prefix reuse. It is
not, however, a fix for the Metal corruption diagnosed here: repeated Metal
embedding requests were observed to become non-finite even with prompt caching,
context checkpoints, and slot-similarity routing disabled. Cache and slot
settings therefore do not replace output validation or recovery through an
Ollama-managed CPU runner.

Run `llama-server --help` for the installed binary before adopting this direct
setup. If any of these flags are unavailable, upgrade the bundled llama.cpp
binary or use Ollama's normal `/v1/embeddings` route instead. AgentsView's
validation remains the final safety boundary either way: invalid endpoint output
is never written. The explicit `ollama_cpu_fallback` recovery is available only
through Ollama's `/v1` endpoint because it depends on Ollama's native
`/api/embed` runner controls; it does not apply to a standalone `llama-server`.

## What gets embedded: units, not messages

The index embeds **unit documents**, not individual messages:

- Every embeddable user message (non-system, not system-prefixed) is its own
  document.
- Assistant messages between those user messages are concatenated — in order,
  separated by blank lines — into one **run** document per stretch of work. A
  run captures a whole narrative arc (analysis, tool narration, conclusions)
  instead of scattering it across hundreds of short fragments.

This matters for both quality and cost. Most assistant messages are short,
procedural narration that is meaningless as a standalone search hit; grouped
into runs, roughly 1.1 million assistant messages collapse into ~44k documents —
about 25x fewer assistant-side documents to embed and rank. Long documents are
chunked at `max_input_chars` runes (default 8192) with a 15% overlap between
consecutive chunks (1228 runes at the default; 375 at a 2500 cap), so an initial
build sends several times fewer encode requests than a per-message scheme would.

Content from sidechains and delegated (subagent/fork) sessions is embedded too,
but classified **subordinate**: still searchable, annotated in results, and
ranked below top-level human-driven work. The
[`--scope` flag](#scoping-results-scope) controls whether you see it.

## Building the index

```bash
agentsview embeddings build            # incremental: refresh + fill whatever's missing
agentsview embeddings build --yes      # skip confirmation prompts
agentsview embeddings build --full-rebuild --yes  # re-embeds every document
agentsview embeddings build --backstop # force a full mirror reconciliation scan
agentsview embeddings build --repair-invalid # regenerate only documents with invalid stored vectors
agentsview embeddings build --include-automated  # embed automated sessions for this build only
agentsview embeddings build --using build-box    # encode against a named server instead of the default
```

`--using <name>` selects which `[vector.embeddings.servers.<name>]` entry the
build encodes against; without it the build uses `default_server`. A mistyped
name fails immediately, before anything starts.

`--include-automated` overrides `[vector].include_automated` for this one build;
it does not change the config file. Bare `--include-automated` embeds automated
sessions, and `--include-automated=false` force-excludes them even if the config
default is `true`. It is meant for a one-off build, not scheduled ones: the
after-sync scheduler and periodic backstop always build from the config value,
so mixing the flag with a different config default flips the index's scope back
and forth on every other build, forcing a full mirror reconciliation each time.
Set `include_automated = true` in `config.toml` instead if you want automated
sessions embedded on every build.

`--repair-invalid` targets the existing generation whose fingerprint matches the
current embedding configuration; it fails without writing if that generation
does not exist. It does not accept a generation ID. The command scans stored
documents with a revision-current generation stamp in bounded batches and checks
for malformed byte length, a length that differs from the generation's declared
dimension, missing referenced vector rows, duplicate, missing, or unexpected
chunk indices, non-finite components, and zero norm. Documents already pending
because their content changed are left for an ordinary build. If one chunk is
invalid, AgentsView invalidates that document's target-generation chunks and
stamp, then runs a repair-only fill restricted to the affected document keys.
Each bounded invalidation transaction queues its targets before removing old
data, so interruption during a large scan remains resumable without holding
every affected document in memory.

Repair never refreshes or expands the document mirror, creates or resets a
generation, or changes generation state. Valid documents, other generations, and
unrelated work that was already pending are preserved. A later ordinary
`embeddings build` handles that unrelated work. Queued targets are cleared only
after non-empty replacement vectors are saved, except when the current queued
revision splits into zero chunks and is validly completed by an empty-document
stamp. Once queued, a document remains a repair target across content revisions:
a stale save writes nothing, and the next repair reads the latest mirrored
content. This ownership applies only to documents already identified as corrupt,
not to unrelated pending changes. An ordinary build that saves non-empty
validated vectors for the queued generation also clears the target. An ordinary
permanent rejection may write an empty skip stamp, but it leaves the repair
target queued; a rejection inside repair writes no stamp. Timeouts,
cancellations, and retryable service errors abort repair immediately. Full
rebuilds preserve queued targets before refill, so an empty permanent-skip stamp
during that rebuild cannot erase repair ownership. A permanent rejection inside
repair remains queued and unstamped, but repair attempts later targets before
returning a nonzero aggregate error. A failure after a valid save but before
queue cleanup may leave a valid stamp; the queued target is still retried
safely. Repair never uses the ordinary build's empty-vector skip stamp. Mirror
deletion removes queued targets for documents that no longer exist; the queue
has a document-key index so that cleanup does not scan all interrupted repairs.

A nonempty mapping is valid only when its sorted chunk indices exactly match the
configured splitter's output and every mapping references a valid vector. A
stamped document with no chunk mappings is not classified as corruption, because
ordinary builds intentionally use that representation for a document the
endpoint permanently rejects. Raw vector rows with no chunk mapping are also
outside repair scope: they cannot be surfaced as search hits. The scan is
explicit because its work scales with the stored generation; scheduled delta and
backstop builds do not run it automatically. CLI repair statistics report the
queued target count and the chunk mappings invalidated by the current scan; the
ordinary embedded count reports successful replacements. Repair succeeds only
after the integrity scan completes and the durable target queue is empty. On a
failed repair, the CLI prints the partial result, including whether the scan
completed plus failed and remaining target counts, before returning a nonzero
status. A later scan-batch failure retains counts from earlier committed batches
and best-effort reports the durable queue size. The committed count remains the
fallback, and cancellation does not cancel the short queue recount. If that
recount also fails, the result marks the count unknown and the CLI reports
`remaining unknown` rather than presenting the fallback as exact. Failed target
counts cover non-stale encode/save failures that determine or accompany the
invocation failure. Stale saves remain in the ordinary stale count, sibling work
canceled after another failure is not counted, and scan failures are reported
through the incomplete scan state.

The repair status contract requires local daemon API version 3. After upgrading
AgentsView, restart any explicitly managed daemon; the CLI rejects an older
daemon instead of treating absent completion or certainty fields as false.

`--repair-invalid` is mutually exclusive with both `--full-rebuild` and
`--backstop`: repair preserves the existing mirror and valid work, while those
modes deliberately rebuild or reconcile broader index state.

`embeddings build` mirrors the embeddable universe (user documents and assistant
runs, see [What gets embedded](#what-gets-embedded-units-not-messages)) into
`vectors.db`, then fills whatever the active generation is missing.
`--full-rebuild` re-embeds every document: if the target fingerprint (derived
from `model`, `dimension`, `max_input_chars`, configured input affixes, the
document-unit scheme, and the derived chunk overlap) differs from the active
generation, it cuts a new **generation**; if the fingerprint is unchanged, it
instead resets and refills the active generation in place rather than cutting a
new one. It prompts for confirmation with a live count of embeddable unit
documents unless `--yes` is passed. Progress prints every ~2 seconds while a
build runs, and a summary line reports documents embedded, chunks, skipped, and
stale counts on completion.

The web Settings page shows the same daemon-owned build while it runs, including
the scan or embedding phase, model and dimension, chunk progress, throughput,
elapsed time, estimated completion, and the generations already stored in
`vectors.db`.

![Embedding build progress](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/settings-embeddings.png)

When a writable local daemon is running, `build`/`activate`/`retire` proxy to it
over HTTP so the daemon remains the sole writer of `vectors.db`; without a
daemon, the CLI takes a dedicated `vectors.write.lock` in the data directory and
runs the build in-process. If [`run_after_sync`](#enabling-vector) is enabled,
the daemon also embeds sync deltas automatically on a debounce, so a manual
`build` is mainly for the initial index or a `--full-rebuild`.

```bash
agentsview embeddings list
```

```text
ID  STATE     MODEL              DIM  EMBEDDED  MISSING  FINGERPRINT
1   active    nomic-embed-text   768  482       0        3f2a9c1e0b7d
```

Generations move through **building → active → retired**. A first build
activates automatically once it reaches full coverage.

```bash
agentsview embeddings activate <id> [--force]
agentsview embeddings retire <id> [--force]
```

`activate` on a generation with incomplete coverage, or `retire` on the
currently active generation, is refused unless `--force` is passed.

## Searching: `session search --semantic` / `--hybrid`

### Command Palette

The web command palette offers **Full text**, **Semantic**, and **Hybrid**
modes. Semantic ranks message content by meaning, while Hybrid combines semantic
and FTS5 rankings. Both present the highest-ranked match from each session, with
at most one result per session, and remember the selected mode across palette
openings and browser sessions.

After entering a query, the project selector shows the current project scope. It
starts with the sidebar project filter; choose **All Projects** to search across
projects without changing the sidebar.

Use the date-range picker beside the search modes to limit the search to
sessions active during a relative, calendar, or custom range. The default is
**All time**. Changing the range reruns the query, and the range stays selected
when switching search modes. Closing the palette resets it to All time. Semantic
and Hybrid interpret dates in your browser's timezone; Full text uses UTC. Dates
filter session activity, not individual message timestamps, so a match from a
session that overlaps the range can contain an earlier or later message.

Semantic and Hybrid depend on the same enabled `[vector]` configuration and
active embeddings index described above. If `[vector]` is not configured, the
palette shows a copyable configuration example plus the build and restart steps.
If vector search is configured but no active index exists, **Build embeddings**
starts the build through the local daemon and reports scanning, progress,
throughput, and completion in place. The palette follows an already running
build and retries the query after a successful build.

![Guided semantic-search setup in the command palette](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/semantic-search-setup.png)

Setup and rebuild errors remain visible in the selected mode. To continue with
Full text after an error, choose it explicitly—the UI never falls back
automatically. The in-session find bar remains unchanged and does not support
semantic search.

Palette searches run after a 300ms typing pause. Each Semantic or Hybrid query
must be encoded, so a remote embeddings server can add latency and per-request
cost compared with a local encoder.

### Command-line search

`--semantic` and `--hybrid` are new content-search modes alongside
`--regex`/`--fts`, mutually exclusive with each other and with the substring
default:

```bash
agentsview session search "database connection pooling" --semantic --limit 10
agentsview session search "flaky test" --hybrid --project myapp
```

- `--semantic` ranks by cosine similarity against the query's embedding.
- `--hybrid` fuses the semantic ranking with an FTS5 ranking of the same corpus
  using reciprocal rank fusion, so exact-term matches and meaning-based
  matches both surface.
- Both modes are restricted to the `messages` source — the same restriction
  `--fts` already has — since only user/assistant message content is embedded
  (never raw tool_input/tool_result rows or system messages). Passing `--in`
  with any other source is rejected.
- All the usual filters apply: `--project`, `--agent`, `--machine`, `--date*`,
  etc. Metadata filters are applied *after* the vector leg over-fetches
  candidates (4x the requested limit) — see [Limitations](#limitations). In
  these two modes [`--scope`](#scoping-results-scope) replaces
  `--include-children` for deciding whether delegated-session content appears.
- Results are a single ranked page: `--cursor` is rejected for
  `--semantic`/`--hybrid` with a clear error, since RRF and cosine ranking
  don't have a stable offset to page from. Every match carries a `score` field
  (cosine similarity, or the RRF score for hybrid); substring/regex/fts
  matches leave `score` unset.
- An empty query pattern (`""`) returns no matches rather than an error, on
  every mode.

Human output shows the score inline:

```text
abc123  #42 score=0.87  myapp  message
    ...ideas for pooling database connections across worker threads...
```

### Hit shape: ranges and anchors

Every content-search match, in every mode, cites a *conversation unit* — a user
message, or a run of assistant messages between user turns — anchored to one
specific message inside it:

- `ordinal` is the **anchor**: the exact matched message, same as every other
  release. For user messages and single-message units it's the message's own
  ordinal.
- `ordinal_range` is `[start, end]` — the conversation unit containing the
  anchor. It is always present, never omitted: a single-message unit
  serializes `[ordinal, ordinal]`, and a unit starting at ordinal 0 still
  serializes its start.
- `subordinate`, `relationship`, `parent_session_id`, and `is_sidechain` carry
  the hit's lineage in every mode: whether it came from a sidechain or a
  delegated (subagent/fork) session, and which parent session to corroborate
  against. These stay `omitempty`; a missing key unambiguously means top-level
  / no lineage.

What the range *means* depends on the mode:

- **Semantic hits and hybrid unit hits** carry the embedded unit's span from the
  vector index — the identity of the document that actually matched.
- **Substring, regex, and FTS matches** (and hybrid hits whose message has no
  embedded unit) carry a **structurally derived** unit computed from the
  archive's messages alone, using the same user-message/assistant-run rules
  the index uses. Lexical citations therefore need no vector index and never
  change with index state. Derived and embedded spans coincide except where
  the index's scope diverges from structure: sessions excluded from the build
  (`include_automated = false`) and messages newer than the last index
  refresh.

Lexical row cardinality is unchanged: substring/regex/FTS still return one row
per matching source row, with the same snippets — the range and lineage fields
are additive metadata on each row.

Human output renders a multi-message unit as `#<start>-<end> @<anchor>` and
marks subordinate hits with `sub`; both can appear in any mode:

```text
def456  #12-40 @19 sub score=0.71  myapp  message
    ...decided to key runs on the first member so tail growth is cheap...
```

### Scoping results: `--scope`

`--scope top|all|subordinate` (HTTP/MCP: `scope`) controls whether subordinate
content — sidechain runs and subagent/fork session content — appears in semantic
and hybrid results:

- `all` (default): everything is searchable; subordinate hits are downranked
  below top-level hits of similar relevance and annotated, never hidden.
- `top`: only top-level, human-driven conversation. Use this when reconstructing
  decisions — delegated sessions repeat their parent's instructions and can
  drown out the conversation where the decision was actually made.
- `subordinate`: only sidechain/delegated content, e.g. to find what a subagent
  actually did.

`--scope` is only valid with `--semantic`/`--hybrid` (other modes reject it) and
supersedes `--include-children` there: child sessions are always visible to
these modes so that `scope` alone governs what you see. Subagent/fork-typed and
parent-linked sessions are also exempt from the default one-shot exclusion in
these modes — a subagent session structurally has exactly one "user" message
(its task prompt), so the one-shot gate would otherwise hide nearly all of them.
Substring, regex, and FTS modes keep the existing `--include-children` and
one-shot behavior unchanged.

### MCP all-terms exchange search

The MCP `search_content` tool also has a `terms` mode for literal multi-term
recall without an embedding query. It splits `pattern` on whitespace and
requires every term inside one exchange: a user message plus the assistant run
that follows it on the same main or sidechain branch. Terms can occur in
different messages. Tool and system content does not participate, and `%`, `_`,
and backslashes are ordinary characters rather than wildcard syntax.

Terms results are ordered with top-level exchanges first, then newest session
activity, with stable session and ordinal tie breaks. `scope=top`, `all`, or
`subordinate` applies before the final limit. Exact `session_id`, raw
`git_branch`, project, agent, and UTC date filters use the same SQLite and
PostgreSQL session scope as semantic and hybrid retrieval.

For a recall request from a known running conversation, pass its full ID as
`current_session_id`. This excludes that session before the limit and disables
the broader ten-minute activity guard, so an unrelated recent session remains
searchable. Limits default to 10 and go up to 50; a value outside that range
falls back to the default. Responses state the effective mode and scope and
which default exclusions applied; `next_cursor` is present when another page
exists.

### Inline context: `--context N`

```bash
agentsview session search "database connection pooling" --semantic --context 2
```

Every match gets `N` messages of context before and after it in the same
response — `context_before`/`context_after` arrays in JSON, indented
`role: content` lines around the match in human output. This works with every
search mode and costs one extra windowed query per hit. Values above 10 are
rejected with `context: maximum is 10` rather than silently clamped. Context
messages are secret-redacted by default, same as `--reveal` governs for the
match snippet itself.

## Cursor-follow: from a hit to its surrounding conversation

Every content-search match — regardless of mode — returns a
`(session_id, ordinal)` cursor. Use `session messages --around` to pull a window
of the conversation around that ordinal without re-running the search:

```bash
agentsview session messages <session-id> --around 42 --before 5 --after 5
agentsview session messages <session-id> --around 42 --role user,assistant
```

- `--around <ordinal>` centers a window on that message; `--before`/`--after`
  default to 5 and require `--around`. `--around` is mutually exclusive with
  `--from`/`--direction`.
- `--role` filters to a comma-separated role list (e.g. `user,assistant`). With
  a role filter, `--before`/`--after` count *filtered* messages, not raw
  ordinals — the anchor message is always included regardless of its role.
- The response reports the window's first/last ordinals, so you can keep paging
  forward with
  `agentsview session messages <id> --from <last+1> --role user,assistant` to
  walk the rest of the session's user/assistant history. There is no
  unpaginated "give me everything" mode.
- `--before`/`--after` are clamped so the total window never exceeds the
  server's message-page limit (1000 messages); an oversized request is
  silently capped rather than rejected.

The typical workflow: run `session search --semantic "<query>"`, take the
`session_id`/`ordinal` off a hit, then
`session messages <session-id> --around <ordinal>` to read what led up to it and
what followed. For a hit whose unit spans a multi-message run, `ordinal` is the
anchor — the member the matched text belongs to — so centering `--around` on it
lands in the right part of the run; widen `--before`/`--after` toward the ends
of `ordinal_range` to read the whole stretch.

Over HTTP (`GET /api/v1/search/content`) and MCP (`search_content`), the "not
available" family of errors maps to HTTP `501 Not Implemented` and the matching
MCP tool error, carrying the same remediation text.

## PostgreSQL

The `--pg` read path and `agentsview pg serve` support semantic and hybrid
search backed by [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector), so a shared
PostgreSQL deployment answers `--semantic`/`--hybrid` the same way a local
SQLite index does. Only the DuckDB mirror lacks a vector backend and still
returns the "not available" error (HTTP 501).

### Pushing embeddings

`agentsview pg push` runs a vector phase after the session and message phases:
it copies the machine's active generation from the local `vectors.db` mirror
into PostgreSQL as per-generation `halfvec` chunk tables. Only the active
generation is pushed, and only sessions whose document set changed since the
last push are re-sent, mirroring the incremental session push (`pg push --full`
bypasses the change detection and re-sends every session's vectors). The
`pg push` summary reports the phase as
`Vectors: N session(s) pushed, ... docs, ... chunks`, or
`Vectors: skipped (<reason>)` when it does not run.

Skip the phase for a single run with `--no-vectors`, or disable it persistently:

```toml
[pg]
push_vectors = false
```

`push_vectors` defaults to true, so a machine with `[vector]` enabled pushes its
embeddings automatically. A machine without `[vector]` enabled has no generation
to push and skips the phase regardless.

### Serving semantic search

`pg serve` — and every `--pg` direct-read command — wires PG-backed semantic
search at startup when three conditions hold on the serving host:

1. `[vector]` is enabled in that host's `config.toml`.
1. The host's embedding config fingerprint (model, dimension, chunking, prompt
   affixes) matches a generation already pushed to PostgreSQL. The fingerprint
   is immutable, so a startup match cannot go stale while the process runs;
   changing the local embeddings config changes the fingerprint and requires a
   restart to pick up.
1. The configured embeddings server is reachable from the serving host, because
   query text is embedded at search time with the same encoder the index was
   built with.

If no generation matches, `pg serve` starts normally but semantic and hybrid
search return the 501 "not available" error carrying the mismatch reason, which
lists the fingerprints PostgreSQL does have so an operator can tell a "wrong
config" miss from a "never pushed" one. A missing pgvector extension or vector
tables degrade the same way — see
[Backends without pgvector](#backends-without-pgvector).

### Shared generations across machines

A generation is keyed by its config fingerprint, so every machine with an
identical `[vector.embeddings]` config pushes into the *same* PostgreSQL
generation. Their documents and chunks accumulate side by side, and any serving
host with the matching fingerprint searches the union. Coverage is partial by
construction: a session becomes semantically searchable only once the machine
that owns it has pushed its embeddings, so a freshly pushed session's text can
match lexically (through the hybrid keyword leg) before its vectors arrive.

### Storage and indexing

Embeddings are stored as pgvector `halfvec` (16-bit) columns, one chunk table
per generation, each indexed with an HNSW cosine index. `halfvec` halves storage
versus 32-bit `vector` and stays under HNSW's dimension ceiling, so models up to
2560 dimensions index cleanly where plain `vector` cannot. Per-generation tables
are required because a pgvector column has a fixed typed dimension.

### Backends without pgvector

Semantic search degrades gracefully when the extension is absent or too old.
`pg push` best-effort runs `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector`; if that
fails — CockroachDB, which has no pgvector; a database where the extension
package is not installed; or a role lacking `CREATE` privilege — schema setup
logs a one-line notice and continues, and the vector phase is skipped. `halfvec`
needs pgvector 0.7.0 or newer: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS` never upgrades
an existing extension object, so when an older version is installed `pg push`
attempts `ALTER EXTENSION vector UPDATE` (healing servers whose pgvector package
was upgraded in place) and otherwise skips the vector phase, reporting the
installed version. Session and message sync are unaffected in every case. On the
read side a missing vector table is treated as "no generation found", so
`pg serve` starts and only `--semantic`/`--hybrid` return 501 while lexical
search keeps working.

### Maintenance

`agentsview pg vectors list` prints every generation with its model, dimension,
document and chunk counts, contributing machines, and creation time.
`agentsview pg vectors drop <id>` removes a generation and all of its embeddings
(prompted unless `--yes`); use it to reclaim space after retiring an embedding
model. Both accept `--target` to select a non-default PG target.

### Hybrid keyword leg

Both backends fuse the same two legs with the same reciprocal-rank merge, but
their keyword legs rank differently. SQLite's hybrid keyword leg is BM25-ranked
through FTS5; PostgreSQL's is an `ILIKE` scan ordered by recency (newest first).
The vector leg, the RRF fusion, the subordinate-unit penalty, scope filtering,
and hit anchoring are identical, so top results usually agree — but the
keyword-leg input order, and therefore fusion ties broken by keyword rank, can
differ between the backends.

## Limitations

- **Metadata filters post-filter the vector leg.** `--semantic`/`--hybrid`
  over-fetch candidates from the vector index (4x the requested limit, or a
  fixed minimum if that's larger), then drop hits whose session fails
  `--project`/`--agent`/`--date*`/etc., then truncate to the requested limit.
  At small corpus sizes or with a narrow filter, this can return fewer than
  `--limit` results even though more exist. A narrow `--scope` (and, in
  hybrid, matches concentrated in one long run) can likewise return fewer than
  `--limit` even when more matches exist deeper in the ranking. This is a
  known v1 tradeoff, not a bug.
- **Legacy no-`source_uuid` rows re-embed on ordinal shifts.** Each embedded
  document is keyed by its first message's stable per-message UUID when the
  parser recorded one, or by `(session_id, ordinal)` when it didn't.
  UUID-keyed documents survive ordinal renumbering (e.g. from a resync) as a
  cheap metadata update with no re-embed; ordinal-keyed documents are treated
  as new and re-embedded when their ordinal shifts. This only affects older
  parsed data predating per-message UUIDs and is an accepted cost rather than
  a bug.
- **The active run re-embeds as it grows.** A run document is keyed on its first
  message, so a session's trailing run keeps its identity as new assistant
  messages append — but its content changes, so each build re-embeds the
  current tail. That is the intended cost of grouping; finished runs never
  re-embed.
- **DuckDB mirror has no vector backend.** `--semantic`/`--hybrid` against a
  DuckDB-backed server return the "not available" error (HTTP 501) described
  above. PostgreSQL is supported through pgvector — see
  [PostgreSQL](#postgresql).
- **The index embeds message `content` verbatim.** Like `--fts`, it only draws
  from the `messages` source, so raw tool_input/tool_result rows are never
  candidates. System messages are handled more strictly, though: `--fts` still
  includes them unless the caller passes `--exclude-system`, while
  `--semantic`/`--hybrid` always exclude system messages from the index with
  no flag to opt back in. But anything a parser rendered *into* a
  user/assistant message's content is embedded with it: thinking text
  flattened inline as `[Thinking]...[/Thinking]` markers, and tool-call
  summaries some parsers render into assistant content, are all ordinary message
  text to the index. Run documents concatenate that per-message text unchanged
  — no role labels or markers are injected between members.

## Skills for coding agents

`agentsview skills install` writes a bundled skill file that teaches a
coding-agent harness the search workflow described on this page: when to reach
for `--hybrid` versus `--fts`, when to use plain substring search over
`tool_input`/`tool_result` for identifiers, how to pass `--exclude-session` so
the live conversation does not fill the page, how to react to the
[error taxonomy](#error-taxonomy), and how to walk from a hit into its
surrounding conversation with
[`session messages --around`](#cursor-follow-from-a-hit-to-its-surrounding-conversation).

```bash
agentsview skills install                    # both harnesses, user level
agentsview skills install --harness claude   # one harness only
agentsview skills install --project          # install under the current git root
agentsview skills install --server URL       # bake remote-daemon flags into examples
agentsview skills list                       # show install state per harness
```

| `agents`    | `$HOME/.agents/skills/agentsview-finding-history/SKILL.md` — the open convention Codex reads (per Codex's own skills docs) |

`--project` swaps the base from the home directory to the current git root (or
the working directory itself outside a repo), writing to `.claude/skills/...`
and `.agents/skills/...` instead.

Every rendered file carries a `generated-by` header with a content hash, written
as a YAML comment just inside the frontmatter fence so the file still starts
with `---` and harnesses keep discovering it. `install` overwrites a file whose
hash still matches its header (unmodified since the last install) but refuses a
file that was hand-edited or was never generated by `agentsview`, printing which
paths it refused and exiting non-zero; pass `--force` to overwrite anyway.
Re-run `agentsview skills install` after upgrading `agentsview` to pick up skill
content changes — the header records the CLI version for humans, but the content
hash, not the version, decides whether a reinstall is a no-op.

`agentsview skills list [--project] [--format json]` reports each harness's
install state — `missing`, `current`, `stale` (unmodified but older than the
current render), `modified`, or `foreign` (no header) — without writing
anything.

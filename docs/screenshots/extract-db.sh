### Code Review Engine Improvements

The main focus was on the code review engine. Two sessions worked on improving how review findings are grouped and deduplicated before being presented to the user.

- **Finding deduplication** — added content-hash-based dedup to prevent the same issue from appearing multiple times when files are re-reviewed. Implemented in `internal/review/dedup.go` with a sliding window approach.
- **Severity classification** — refined the severity model to distinguish between style issues, potential bugs, and architectural concerns. Updated the prompt templates in `internal/review/prompts/`.

### Test Coverage

One session focused entirely on adding test coverage for the new dedup logic. Added table-driven tests covering edge cases: overlapping findings, findings across file boundaries, and hash collisions.

### Tool Usage

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Read     | 12    |
| Edit     | 8     |
| Bash     | 5     |
| Search   | 3     |',

'## Weekly Analysis — Feb 14–20

### Overview

18 sessions across 3 projects over 7 days. Total: 312 messages, 187 tool calls.

| Project | Sessions | Messages | Tool Calls |
|---------|----------|----------|------------|
| roborev | 10 | 198 | 124 |
| agentsview | 5 | 72 | 41 |

### Patterns

**Session length** — median session was 14 messages. Longest session (38 messages) was a roborev refactoring session that touched 12 files. Shorter sessions (under 8 messages) were typically quick bug fixes or documentation updates.

**Tool distribution** — Read and Edit dominate at 68% of all tool calls. Bash usage is concentrated in roborev (test runs and linting). Search tool usage is low, suggesting good familiarity with the codebases.

**Time of day** — most sessions start between 9–11am and 2–4pm, with a gap around lunch. No late-night sessions this week.

### Effectiveness

- Sessions that started with a clear, specific prompt ("fix the failing test in dedup_test.go") completed faster (avg 8 messages) than open-ended ones ("improve the review engine") which averaged 22 messages.
- Tool call errors were rare (3 out of 187), all from file paths that had been renamed mid-session.

### Recommendations

1. **Break up long sessions** — the 38-message refactoring session could have been 2–3 focused sessions with clearer scope.
2. **Use search more** — several sessions spent multiple Read calls navigating to the right file. A Grep or Glob call upfront would save turns.
3. **Pin test commands** — repeated manual test invocations could be replaced with a single Bash alias or Makefile target.',

'## Summary

4 sessions in agentsview today, totaling 62 messages and 35 tool calls.

### Frontend Improvements

Two sessions focused on the analytics dashboard. Added a stacked activity timeline chart with daily, weekly, and monthly granularity. The chart uses SVG with D3 scales for responsive rendering.

- **Timeline chart** — implemented in `frontend/src/lib/components/analytics/ActivityTimeline.svelte` with agent-colored stacking and tooltip on hover.
- **Date range picker** — added quick presets (7d, 30d, 90d, 1y, All) alongside custom date inputs.

### Session Export

One session added standalone HTML export for sessions. The exported file includes all messages, tool calls, and thinking blocks with inline CSS so it renders correctly offline.

### Bug Fix

Fixed a race condition where concurrent search and session-load requests could return stale results. Added request cancellation via `AbortController`.',

### API Endpoint Refactoring

Refactored the review submission API to accept batch requests. Previously each file was submitted individually, which caused N+1 request patterns on large PRs. The new endpoint accepts an array of file paths and returns all findings in a single response.

- Updated `internal/server/review_handler.go` with batch support
- Added request validation for max batch size (50 files)
- Updated the CLI client to use the batch endpoint

### Documentation

One short session updated the API documentation in `docs/api.md` to reflect the new batch endpoint and its request/response schema.',

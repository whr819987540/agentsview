# Background Work and Memory

Read this file before changing watchers, polling, sync scheduling, or other
long-running background work. Also read it before investigating memory growth.

## The internal/poller Scheduler

Define interval-driven jobs against external APIs or shared resources as
`poller.Job` values passed to `poller.Start` at daemon startup. Jobs cannot be
added later. The scheduler owns jitter, cooldown recorded before attempts,
capped failure backoff, `RetryAfterError`, and cancellation. Status is in memory
only; `TriggerNow` bypasses cooldown.

Pricing refresh uses the scheduler. Periodic session sync, vector embedding,
and recall extraction still own their timing; migrating them is separate work.

## Memory and Work Bounds

- Keep passive daemon memory within a few hundred megabytes on macOS, Linux, and
  Windows. Treat sustained growth beyond that range as a regression.

- Bound watcher, polling, and sync work by the changed batch, not the full
  archive. Do not scan or load every stored session for each filesystem event.
- A rejected parser checkpoint forbids resuming from its cursor. It must not
  force a transcript rewrite when the full source hash and stored metadata
  still match. Filesystem device numbers can change across boots.
- Declare costly scheduling inputs as provider capabilities. Compute them only
  for providers that use them, and default new capabilities to unsupported.
- Add cardinality-scaling regressions for background paths. Compare small and
  large archives and prove that unchanged work per event stays bounded. Cover
  deletion, tombstones, and persistent archives in the same tests.
- Diagnose long-running memory with allocation and CPU profiles, live heap,
  forced-GC heap, and operating-system physical or dirty memory. Raw RSS does
  not prove live memory because it includes clean reclaimable mappings.
- Profile branch binaries only against isolated, production-scale database and
  source clones. Never use live archives or agent transcripts.
- Observe retention long enough to reproduce the reported growth window. On
  macOS, record `vmmap` physical footprint and dirty memory. Use portable Go
  allocation and heap metrics on Linux and Windows.

## Usage cache backfill

- Start usage-cache backfill only after the writable archive transaction that
  changed a session has committed. Mutation hooks enqueue session IDs; they
  never fill while holding the archive writer.
- Foreground fills are per-session single-flight and detached from request
  cancellation. Cancelling one waiter must not cancel shared progress.
- Detached fills and rollup builds hold their own cache-generation lease.
  Retirement cancels their coordinator context and waits for those leases
  before closing SQLite handles.
- A writable daemon runs one newest-usage-first coverage pass after HTTP
  readiness. It installs at most 256 sessions per cache transaction and yields
  between batches. The pass fills normalized facts and daily rollups for the
  process-local timezone plus up to eight retained recently requested explicit
  timezones. Installed source and aggregate fingerprints, not a progress
  cursor, are the authoritative coverage records.
- A pass runs once and is never restarted because the archive was written while
  it ran. Each session's facts and source version come from one archive read
  transaction, so they are always paired correctly, and a session written
  during the pass is refilled by its own mutation notification. Do not
  reintroduce a restart loop over a moving source fingerprint.
- Sweep the archive deletion journal before and after the pass and between
  install batches. Queries also inner-join current archive sessions before
  ranking, so tombstone processing is hygiene rather than a correctness
  dependency.
- Run incremental vacuum between batches only when the cache freelist exceeds
  4,096 pages, and reclaim at most 256 pages per call.
- Run `PRAGMA optimize` between substantial batches and after install-heavy
  foreground fills. Run full `ANALYZE` after generation creation and complete
  initial backfill, not after every batch.
- Keep the selected session batch outermost in rollup fact and cross-session
  identity queries. An identity index scan still reads the whole cache; verify
  that query plans seek facts by selected session before checking identities.
- Backfill logs aggregate counts and elapsed time only. Do not log session IDs,
  projects, paths, prompts, or fact contents.
- Keep newest-first fact plus process-local-rollup coverage within 30 seconds
  and complete fact plus process-local-rollup archive coverage within five
  minutes on the protected production-scale benchmark clone. These are release
  gates, not reasons to delay daemon readiness. A foreground request for an
  unbuilt timezone or all-history coverage remains exact and may pay the
  remaining `fill facts -> build rollups -> read` cold cost.

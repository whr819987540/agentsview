# S3 Provider Rules

Read this file before enabling S3 ingest for an agent, changing `S3Provider` /
`Source.S3Discovery`, or altering S3 discovery, session IDs, temp
materialization, or post-fetch hydrate.

Operator configuration and object layouts live in `docs/configuration.md` under
S3-Compatible Session Sources. This guide is the implementer contract.

## When S3 Fits

S3 ingest is for single-file session objects under:

```text
s3://<bucket>/.../<machine>/raw/<agent>/...
```

The `<agent>` path segment must be the provider's `AgentType` string. The engine
uses that segment plus `Source.S3Discovery` to decide which objects belong to
which agent. Multi-file containers, SQLite stores, and agents that cannot name a
session from one object path do not belong here.

## Required Surface

1. Implement `parser.S3Provider` in `internal/parser/s3_provider.go`.
1. Set `Source.S3Discovery` to `CapabilitySupported` on both the factory and the
   constructed provider. Startup migration rejects the capability if the
   provider does not implement the interface.
1. Route `s3://` roots in `Discover` / `DiscoverEach` through
   `s3PrefixScan(root, scanner)` so provider discovery and engine dispatch use
   the same keep/project rules.
1. Skip `s3://` roots in `WatchPlan`. Object storage is not a local watch tree.

## Default Versus Custom

Embed `DefaultS3Provider` when the agent matches the common layout:

- Keep objects whose names end in the declared extensions.
- Project is the first path segment under the configured root.
- Session ID is `IDPrefix` plus the filename stem.
- Temp path strips `raw/<agent>`.
- No sidecar folding and no post-fetch hydrate.

Write a dedicated `<agent>_s3.go` when any of those rules is wrong. Current
custom implementations:

| Codex  | `rollout-*.jsonl` keep, `codex:` UUID IDs, sessions/archived rewrite, parent and `session_index` locate. TraeX shares the type and must not enable S3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Cursor | Harvest `<project>/<id>.{jsonl,txt}` plus local `agent-transcripts` layouts, including a parent session's `subagents` directory; decode encoded project dirs only for the local layout; deduplicate a session stem across configured roots by source machine, preferring a session's own nested or flat object over a copy in another session's `subagents` directory, then `.jsonl`, then nested over flat, then lexical path |

`internal/parser/s3source.go` stays generic transport: client, list, fetch,
stat, and `s3PrefixScan`. Agent policy does not belong there.

## Identity Rules

`S3SessionID` is the durable session key before the engine prefixes the source
machine. Two kept objects that share an ID will overwrite each other.

- Keep only paths that are real transcripts for that agent.
- If `.jsonl` and `.txt` (or any other pair) share a stem, keep one. Prefer the
  format the local parser prefers.
- Validate IDs with the same rules the local provider already uses.
- Do not invent a second discover wrapper that bypasses the scanner. Extra
  post-processing (prefer `.jsonl`, fold sidecars) belongs next to the
  scanner.

## Tests

Protect the keep and identity contract with concrete object URIs:

- A documented harvest object is discovered.
- A junk object with the same extension is not.
- Same-stem pairs produce one session ID and one discovered source.
- Forks that share a provider type stay off S3 unless they own the namespace.

## Sync Dispatch

After the capability is set, `internal/sync/s3.go` and
`internal/sync/s3_source.go` dispatch through `S3ProviderFor`. Do not add
another `switch file.Agent` for the new agent.

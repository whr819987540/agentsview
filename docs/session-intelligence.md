title: Session Intelligence
description: Health scores, outcomes, and session-quality analytics in AgentsView
---

Use session health scores to find stalled sessions, repeated tool failures, and
patterns across projects. AgentsView reads the recorded transcript to estimate
each session's outcome and show the evidence behind its score.

!!! note

    These signals are heuristics, not ground truth. They are meant to help with
    triage and pattern-finding, not to replace your own judgment about whether a
    session was actually successful.

## Where It Appears

Session intelligence shows up in four places:

- **Session detail UI** — the session header includes a health grade badge.
    Click it to open the in-session signal panel.
- **Analytics dashboard** — the dashboard includes a **Session Health** section
    with score, outcome, tool-failure, compaction, trend, agent, and project
    breakdowns.
- **Programmatic session surface** — `agentsview session get` and
    `agentsview session list` expose health and outcome fields, plus filters
    such as `--health-grade`, `--outcome`, and `--min-tool-failures`.
- **CLI health view** — `agentsview health` shows either a recent session list
    with grade and outcome columns, or detailed signals for a single session.

For elapsed turn time and measured tool execution, open **Analysis** in a
session. Its [Session Vitals view](/docs/usage/#session-vital-signs) separates
measured tool time from unattributed time and links activity rows to the
transcript. Timing and health scores answer different questions: where time
went, and what patterns deserve attention.

## Health Score

The health score is a penalty-based score out of 100. AgentsView
starts from 100 and subtracts penalties from three categories:

- **Outcome**
- **Tool health**
- **Context pressure**

If the final score exists, it is mapped to a grade:

| Grade | Score |
|------|------:|
| `A` | `90-100` |
| `B` | `75-89` |
| `C` | `60-74` |
| `D` | `40-59` |
| `F` | `0-39` |

Some sessions remain **unscored**. That happens when AgentsView
cannot infer a meaningful result beyond an `unknown` low-confidence
outcome and there is no additional tool-health or context data to
work from.

### Penalty Model

The 0.23.0 score model uses these penalties:

| Signal | Penalty |
|------|------:|
| `errored` outcome | `30` |
| `abandoned` outcome | `15` |
| tool failure signal | `3` each, capped at `30` |
| tool retry | `5` each, capped at `25` |
| edit churn | `4` each, capped at `20` |
| consecutive failure streak of 3+ | `10` |
| extra compactions after the first | `5` each, capped at `15` |
| mid-task compaction | `8` each, capped at `18` |
| context pressure above `0.9` | `10` |

The in-session signal panel shows the exact basis and penalties
used for a scored session.

## Outcome Classification

Every session is classified into one of four outcomes:

- `completed`
- `abandoned`
- `errored`
- `unknown`

Each classification also carries a confidence level:

- `high`
- `medium`
- `low`

The 0.23.0 classifier uses a few simple rules:

- automated sessions default to `unknown`
- very short sessions stay `unknown`
- recently active sessions stay `unknown` until they have clearly
  settled
- sessions that end on a user turn skew toward `abandoned`
- sessions with a final failure streak of 3 or more skew toward
  `errored`
- sessions that end on an assistant turn skew toward `completed`

The analytics dashboard aggregates these into outcome
distributions and completion rates by agent and by project.

## Tool-Health Signals

Tool-health signals are derived from tool-call history, tool
results, and tool-result status events:

- **Failure signals** — counts calls that look failed, either from
  explicit `errored` or `cancelled` status events or from content
  heuristics such as shell errors and `FAILED` write/edit results.
- **Retries** — counts repeated identical tool calls when the same
  tool name and identical input are invoked 3 or more times in a
  row.
- **Edit churn** — counts files that were edited or written 3 or
  more times within a tight ordinal window, which usually signals
  rework.
- **Consecutive failure max** — records the longest run of failed
  tool calls in a session.

These signals feed both the per-session score and the dashboard's
tool-health summary metrics.

## Context Signals

AgentsView also tracks context-pressure-related signals:

- **Compaction count** — how often the session crossed a compact
  boundary.
- **Mid-task compactions** — compactions that interrupted active
  work instead of happening at a clean boundary.
- **Context pressure max** — the highest context-pressure reading
  observed for the session when the parser can infer it.

Mid-task compactions are weighted more heavily than ordinary
compactions because they are a stronger sign that the agent lost
working context and had to recover.

## UI Surfaces

### Session Header And Signal Panel

When a session has intelligence data, the session header shows a
grade badge:

![Grade badge in the session header](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/grade-badge.png)

Clicking it opens the signal panel, which includes:

- grade and numeric score
- outcome icon and confidence
- basis tags showing which categories contributed
- compaction chip with a mid-task indicator when applicable
- penalty chips for the exact deductions applied

![Signal panel with basis tags, compaction chip, and penalty chips](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/signal-panel.png)

If a session does not have enough usable data, the panel renders a
small empty-state message instead of a score.

### Dashboard Health Section

The analytics dashboard's **Session Health** section aggregates the
same per-session signals into:

- average health score
- outcome distribution
- tool-failure rate
- compaction summaries
- score trend over time
- by-agent and by-project tables

![Session Health section on the analytics dashboard](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/session-health.png)

This section is only shown when the current filter window contains
scored or unscored signal-bearing sessions.

## CLI And API Surfaces

### `agentsview health`

`agentsview health` is the human-first CLI for quick inspection.

```bash
agentsview health
agentsview health --limit 50
agentsview health <session-id>
agentsview health <session-id> --json
```

Without a session ID it lists recent sessions with grade and
outcome columns. With a session ID it prints the detailed signal
counts for that session, including tool failures, retries, edit
churn, failure streaks, compactions, and context pressure.

### `agentsview session`

Use the [Session API](/docs/session-api/) docs for the full programmatic
surface. The most relevant commands for session intelligence are:

```bash
agentsview session get <id> --format json
agentsview session list --health-grade A,B --outcome completed
agentsview session list --min-tool-failures 0
```

`session get` returns detail-level fields such as
`health_score_basis` and `health_penalties`. `session list`
exposes health and outcome filters for automation-friendly scans.

## Relationship To `agentsview stats`

Session intelligence is **per-session** and powers the session UI,
the session API, and the dashboard health section.

[`agentsview stats`](/docs/stats/) is different: it is an
**aggregate reporting** command that summarizes windows of session
activity, git activity, tool mix, model mix, and outcome metrics
across the whole workspace.

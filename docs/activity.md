description: Activity, concurrency, and session-time reporting in AgentsView
---

Use **Activity** to see when agents ran, how much work overlapped, and what it
cost. Break down a period by project, model, agent, machine, or session. Open it
from the **Activity** button in the header or directly at `/activity`.

![Default daily Activity view](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/activity-page.png)

The report is built from timestamped session activity and usage rows. It
includes one-shot and automated sessions by default, then lets you narrow the
result with the page controls.

## Range And Filters

The toolbar uses the shared range picker with calendar **Day**, **Week**,
**Month**, and **Custom** selections. Activity opens to the current day. It only
adopts and publishes shared ranges when **Settings > Date ranges > Link date
ranges across pages** is enabled; a shared range wider than Activity can
represent is not adopted.

![Weekly Activity view](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/activity-week.png)

Additional filters scope the report by:

- **Project** — typeahead project filter
- **Agent** — dropdown of all agents present in the activity data
- **Machine** — dropdown of synced machine names
- **Automation** — **All Sessions**, **Interactive**, or **Automated**

Filter and range state is written to the URL with query parameters such as
`preset`, `date`, `from`, `to`, `window_days`, `project`, `agent`, `machine`,
and `automation`.

## Summary Cards

The summary cards show:

- **Interactive peak** — the maximum number of interactive conversations active
  at the same instant, with the clock time of the peak in the report timezone
- **Active** — active wall-clock time, plus idle time in the range
- **Agent-minutes** — combined active minutes across concurrent agents
- **Sessions** — session count, with interactive/subagent/automated and
  untimed-session detail when applicable
- **Projects** and **Models** — distinct counts in the range
- **Total Cost** — selected session cost attributed to activity in the range:
  authoritative reported totals when available, otherwise catalog estimates

The report counts subagent sessions (for example Claude Code Task-tool agents)
and fork sessions (rewound conversation branches) alongside their parent
sessions, so **Total Cost** lines up with `agentsview usage daily` for the same
day and timezone. Usage rows that recur across related sessions are deduplicated
before totaling, the same rule the Usage page applies.

The session count separates subagents from interactive and automated
conversations. A subagent counts only in the subagent category, even if its
prompt also matches the automation classifier. Forks remain in the interactive
or automated category. Costs, agent-minutes, and concurrency use the same three
separate categories. Automation filters still use each session's automation
flag, including subagents.

If the selected range reaches into the future, the page marks it as partial and
shows the report's current **as of** time.

## Concurrency

The **Concurrency** chart is a stacked bar chart on one time axis. Each bucket
is a single bar whose segments are **Interactive** in blue, **Subagents** in
violet, and **Automated** in orange, stacked from the baseline in that order on
one shared scale. Bar height is the bucket's combined concurrency peak, and each
segment is that class's count at the instant of that peak, so the segments
always add up to the bar. The legend above the chart names the segments, and the
label on the right gives the combined peak for the range. The strip below the
bars marks active versus idle buckets across all sessions. Interactive
concurrency counts overlapping human-facing conversations; human attention is
not measured.

![Weekly Activity concurrency chart](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/activity-concurrency.png)

Hover a bucket to see its time range, the stacked split at the combined peak,
the combined peak, each class's own peak within the bucket, agent-minutes, input
and output tokens, and cost. A class's own peak can exceed its segment when that
class peaked at a different instant from the combined peak. The **All-session
overlay** control draws a combined **Tokens** or **Cost** trend over the bars,
with its own scale on the right. These usage totals include all three classes.

Clicking a bucket filters the Sessions table to the sessions active in that time
slot. Drag across buckets to select a range. Keyboard users can select with
Enter or Space, extend with Shift+Arrow, and clear with Escape. Click the same
bucket again, or dismiss the **Active:** badge in the table header, to clear the
slot filter. Membership is computed by the same shared aggregator that builds
the chart, then fetched as a bounded page; the browser no longer downloads every
raw activity interval to perform this drill-down.

## Sessions

The **Sessions** table lists every session that contributed to the report. Rows
include the session title, model, project, agent, agent-minutes, cost, and
active window.

![Weekly Activity sessions table](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/activity-sessions.png)

Click a session title to open that session in the transcript viewer. Column
headers for **Project**, **Agent**, **Agent-min**, **Cost**, and **Window** are
sortable; timing-only sorts keep untimed sessions at the bottom.

The table initially includes at most 200 rows. Sorting, bucket filtering, and
later pages run on the server, with a maximum page size of 500 rows. A loading
indicator remains local to the table, so the report summary and chart stay
visible while a page is fetched.

Subagent sessions are marked with a **Subagent** badge; other automated sessions
have an **Auto** badge. Untimed sessions can still carry cost if usage rows
exist but timestamped activity was unavailable.

## Breakdowns

The **Breakdown** panel ranks activity by **Project**, **Model**, and **Agent**.
Toggle between **Agent-min** and **Cost** to change the metric, and use the
stacked bars to compare interactive, subagent, and automated contributions. Each
session contributes to exactly one segment.

![Weekly Activity breakdowns](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/activity-breakdowns.png)

Rows with no value for the selected metric are omitted from that view, so
cost-only untimed sessions appear in **Cost** but not **Agent-min**.

Project, agent, session, bucket, and report totals use the authoritative session
total when one is available. For a multi-model session, AgentsView allocates
that total across usage rows in proportion to their catalog-price estimates. The
per-model costs are therefore estimated attributions, not provider-reported
model charges, but they still sum to the displayed total.

## Create A Project Mapping

If a branch or worktree directory appears as its own project, correct the
assignment with [project mapping rules](/docs/data/#rules).

When the [opt-in project workspace](/docs/data/#enable-the-project-workspace) is
enabled, each row in the **Project** breakdown links to that project's folder
suggestions and session previews. Review the impact before saving a correction.
The Activity range and filters do not carry over, and mapping rules always apply
across the complete archive.

## Activity Insight

At the bottom of the page, **Activity Insight** shows an existing global
`daily_activity` insight for the exact resolved date range when one exists. If
the server is writable, generate a new insight from the same panel using Claude,
Codex, Copilot, Gemini, or Kiro.

![Weekly Activity Insight panel](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/activity-insight.png)

The **Open in Generated insights** link opens the
[Generated insights](/docs/recall/?tab=generated) tab prefilled with the same range.
Generation is disabled when the connected server cannot run an agent CLI.
Scripts can generate and inspect the same reports with
[`agentsview insight`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-insight).

## CLI And API

The web page uses:

```http
GET /api/v1/activity/report
```

The same report is available from the CLI:

```bash
agentsview activity report --preset day --date 2026-06-20
agentsview activity report --preset week --date 2026-06-20 --json
agentsview activity report --preset custom \
  --from 2026-06-20T14:00:00Z \
  --to 2026-06-20T18:00:00Z \
  --bucket 15m
agentsview activity report --preset month --date 2026-07-01 --json \
  --sessions-limit 200 --sessions-sort cost --sessions-direction desc
```

Large reports emit progress on stderr in both daemon and direct-database modes;
JSON stdout remains one machine-readable document. Use `--sessions-cursor` with
the returned `sessions_next_cursor` to request a later page. In daemon mode,
also pass the paired `report_id` as `--sessions-report-id`; this preserves the
original generation when a current or partial range advances between commands.
The same paging flags work with `--offline`; the signed direct-mode cursor
carries the original resolved range and filters, then deterministically
recomputes that generation before selecting the next page.

See [CLI Reference](/docs/commands/#agentsview-activity-report) and
[Session API](/docs/session-api/#activity-report) for flags and response shape.

### JSON Contract

`agentsview activity report --json` and `/api/v1/activity/report` emit schema
version 8. The report contains a bounded first page of sessions,
`sessions_total`, `sessions_next_cursor`, and a signed `report_id` that keeps
later pages tied to the report. It does not include the old `intervals` array.
The CLI and HTTP API use the same schema version and change together.

Version 8 separates interactive, subagent, and automated sessions in session
counts, agent-minutes, costs, and concurrency. The three class counts sum to
`totals.sessions`; total usage and cost accounting is unchanged. Buckets include
independent `max_interactive_agents`, `max_subagent_agents`, and
`max_automated_agents` values, while the `*_at_peak` fields describe the split
at the combined `max_agents` peak. The report includes `interactive_peak`,
`subagent_peak`, and `automated_peak`, each with its own count and timestamp.
Session rows include `is_subagent`, which takes precedence over `is_automated`
when assigning the visible class.

Clients may request progress from the report route with
`Accept: text/event-stream`. The stream sends `progress` events for loading
sessions, loading usage, scanning activity, finalizing, and completion, followed
by one `report` event. A client that does not request SSE receives ordinary JSON
from the same URL. Both forms use the long-running route path and therefore are
not subject to the normal 30-second API operation timeout; request cancellation
still stops database scans.

Session pages are available at:

```http
GET /api/v1/activity/report/{report_id}/sessions
```

The endpoint accepts `limit`, `cursor`, `sort`, `direction`, and the optional
zero-based half-open range `bucket_start` and `bucket_end`. Both range bounds
must be present. Ordinary page responses contain only the bounded session page.
Stateless clients that also need report metadata can request
`include_report=true`; refresh-required responses always include the complete
replacement report. Ordering always ends with session ID ascending, so a signed
position cursor remains deterministic after cache eviction or daemon restart.
The report token carries the resolved query and a coarse archive probe. Cached
artifacts expire after 15 idle minutes and are bounded by entry, row, and byte
limits; a cache miss recomputes from the token. If the archive generation has
changed, the response sets `refresh_required` and returns a complete replacement
report and first page together, rather than mixing a new table with an old
summary. Sync notifications continue to mark the dashboard stale and do not
automatically reaggregate it.

Version 7 applies provider-specific billing identity to computed usage and
preserves reported cost rows and custom pricing overrides. Costs from v6 and v7
must not be compared as the same billing semantics.

Each project, branch, agent, or machine filter is limited to 1,024 UTF-8 bytes,
with a 3,072-byte combined limit. The server also validates the fully encoded
signed `report_id`, including JSON escaping and base64 expansion, before
aggregation.

Older CLIs do not validate `schema_version` and can decode a v7 plain-JSON
response. The embedded first page deliberately preserves the prior default
ordering—agent-minutes descending, untimed sessions last, session ID ascending
as the final tie-break—so their five-row human summary remains compatible. They
cannot request later pages or consume progress.

The activity report JSON, `agentsview usage daily --json`, and
`agentsview export sessions --format json|ndjson` are separate versioned
surfaces. Usage and activity already emitted `schema_version: 1` before 0.38,
and the session-summary v1 contract shipped in 0.37.1. Releases 0.38.0 and
0.38.1 emitted the substantially revised project-evidence shape while still
reporting version 1. Version 2 corrected those markers, version 3 introduced
exact microdollar money objects, and version 4 adds resolved-model pricing
provenance with complete request-pricing bands and application counts. Those two
transitional releases must not be treated as v1-compatible. Consumers should
require the expected `schema_version` and ignore unknown additive fields. The
commands do not provide an earlier-version output mode.

The activity report includes the shared report-level `pricing` and `projects`
blocks. `pricing.models` is keyed by reported model names. Each entry contains
an aggregate `cost_source` and explicit `resolutions` with `priced_model` and
effective rate fields such as `input_cost_per_mtok`, `output_cost_per_mtok`,
`cache_write_cost_per_mtok`, `cache_write_1h_cost_per_mtok`, and
`cache_read_cost_per_mtok`, plus available
`bands` and report-specific `application` counts. Every project-bearing report
row contains an opaque `project_key`. `projects` is keyed by that value and
carries the presentation-only `display_label`; unknown project identity is
represented by an explicit `resolution` with `identity` omitted.

See [Token Usage & Costs](/docs/token-usage/#json-contract) for the shared bump
rules, [Pricing Provenance](/docs/token-usage/#pricing-provenance) for pricing digest
and `cost_source` semantics, and
[Project Identity](/docs/token-usage/#project-identity) for key derivation and
redaction notes.

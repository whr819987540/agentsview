# See what your AI coding agents did, and what it cost

AgentsView brings your AI coding sessions into one searchable archive. Browse
recorded conversations from more than 60 agent formats, compare activity and
costs, and reuse lessons from past work. The archive stays on your machine
unless you turn on a feature that shares it.

## Install

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://agentsview.io/install.sh | bash
```

On Windows:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://agentsview.io/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Desktop app, pip/uvx, and Docker installs are covered in the
[quick start](/docs/quickstart/). Then [follow the guide](/guide/) or read the
[documentation](/docs/).

## Your coding sessions, in one archive

A background server watches the session directories your agents already write
and imports supported formats into a local SQLite archive. It finds the default
directories automatically. You can configure other locations. Supported
harnesses include Claude Code, OpenClaude, Codex, Augure Code, Augure Desktop,
Cline CLI, Crush, CodeBuddy CN, Gemini, Copilot (CLI, VS Code, and Visual
Studio), Cursor, Cursor IDE, IcodeMate, Qwen Code, DeepSeek TUI and Harness,
Mistral Vibe, Zed, Warp, OpenCode, Positron, Posit Assistant, Claude Cowork,
Aider, Antigravity, gptme, Kilo, Kimi, Kiro, OpenHands, Goose, Grok, RooCode,
Trae, Windsurf, and dozens more. Every supported source is listed in
[session discovery](/docs/configuration/#session-discovery).

- **60+** agent formats parsed
- **1** binary, zero accounts
- **SQLite** archive of record

## See when your agents are actually working

The [Activity dashboard](/docs/activity/) shows peak concurrency and the exact
moment it happened, active versus idle time, agent-minutes across parallel
sessions, and cost. Scope it to any day, week, month, or custom range, and
filter by project, agent, and machine. Live sync streams new messages into the
UI as sessions run.

## Know what every agent costs

[Token and cost reports](/docs/token-usage/) read from the pre-indexed archive
instead of reparsing raw session files every time. Pricing tracks LiteLLM and
OpenRouter rates with an offline fallback, and cache-aware accounting covers
prompt-cache creation and reads.

```bash
agentsview usage daily          # last 30 days, terminal table
agentsview usage statusline     # $9.61 today
agentsview capture run -- claude -p "fix the tests"
```

## Search and score every transcript

Find a conversation by project and date in the
[command palette](/docs/usage/#command-palette), or open it by ID with
`Ctrl/Cmd+G`. Full-text search matches words; opt-in
[semantic and hybrid search](/docs/semantic-search/) match by meaning.
[Health scores](/docs/session-intelligence/) and
[quality signals](/docs/quality/) link back to the transcript so you can check
the evidence.

## Turn transcripts into durable knowledge

[Recall](/docs/recall/) (experimental) extracts decisions, warnings, and project
facts from your archive. Each entry links to the messages that support it.
Generated Insights write model-authored reports over an explicit session scope.

## Your agents can read it too

The same archive you browse is available to your agents:

- **CLI:** scriptable reports and session queries.
- **REST:** programmatic [session and usage access](/docs/session-api/).
- **MCP:** [session history as assistant tools](/docs/mcp/).
- **SSE:** live message streams as sessions run.
- **Web:** embedded Svelte UI served from the binary.
- **Desktop:** native app sharing the same data directory.

An agent can check what a previous session already tried, quote its own history,
or watch its spend mid-run.

## One machine or the whole team

SQLite is the archive of record. From there:

- [PostgreSQL sync](/docs/pg-sync/) pushes each machine's archive to a shared
  team backend with per-machine labels and a read-only merged server.
- [ClickHouse sync](/docs/clickhouse-sync/) serves the dashboard from a remote
  copy. Session edits stay in SQLite.
- [DuckDB mirror](/docs/duckdb/) serves analytical reads locally or over the
  Quack protocol.
- [Filesystem sync](/docs/filesystem-sync/) and
  [artifact folder sync](/docs/artifact-sync/) move sessions between machines
  without any database server.
- [Hosted raw sync](/docs/hosted-raw-sync/) keeps original provider files in
  hosted storage with device authentication and resumable uploads. Hosted
  browsing still requires PostgreSQL sync.
- [Remote access](/docs/remote-access/) stays loopback-only by default, with
  explicit flags for SSH forwards and authenticated exposure.

## Local by default. Shared when you choose

Your agent transcripts are some of the most sensitive data on your machine.
AgentsView starts with one local SQLite archive and a loopback-only server. Data
leaves the machine only when you choose a feature such as PostgreSQL or
ClickHouse sync, remote DuckDB access, Generated Insights, GitHub publishing, or
hosted raw sync. Each feature documents what it sends and where it goes.

## Start

Install AgentsView and it finds the sessions that are already on your machine.

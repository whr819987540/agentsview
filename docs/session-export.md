title: Session Export
description: Content-free session summary exports for scripting and analytics
---

Export session metadata and token and cost totals without transcript text. Use
`agentsview export sessions` for reporting scripts that need pricing and project
identity. JSON produces one document; NDJSON writes one JSON object per line.

## Commands

```bash
agentsview export sessions --format json
agentsview export sessions --format ndjson
```

The command reads the local SQLite archive directly. It does not require a
running daemon and does not stream source transcript files.

## Output Shapes

JSON output is one document:

NDJSON output writes a metadata object as the first line, then writes session
rows on subsequent lines. The metadata line has `"type": "meta"`; session rows
do not add a `type` discriminator.

```json
{"type":"meta","schema_version":6,"archive_id":"00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000002","database_id":"00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001","cursor":{"next":"..."},"pricing":{},"projects":{}}
{"id":"path-current","agent":"claude","model_usage":{"models":["fixture-model-reported"],"input_tokens":300,"output_tokens":60,"cost":{"microdollars":12500},"has_cost":true}}
```

These snippets are abbreviated illustrations. Complete checked JSON and NDJSON
outputs live in `testdata/golden/session_export_v6.json` and
`testdata/golden/session_export_v6.ndjson`.

### Archive and database identity

`archive_id` identifies the logical archive and survives full resync. Within
that archive, `(archive_id, session.id)` identifies a session across rebuilt
database generations. `database_id` identifies the physical database generation
and changes on full resync; pagination cursors remain tied to that generation.
Both IDs come from the same read snapshot as the exported rows, including empty
results and the NDJSON metadata line. Missing archive identity is an error, not
a reason for the read-only export to create an identity.

A changed database ID under the same archive ID means that the archive was
rebuilt, not that every session is new. Restart pagination and reconcile the new
snapshot. Neither ID is an ordered revision, and a cursor is not a durable
change-feed checkpoint. These IDs do not establish which of two delayed exports
is newer or turn absence from a filtered page into a deletion signal. Copied
archives retain their logical identity; applications that ingest independent
copies must define their source scope rather than assume the ID identifies a
device or a single writer.

### Revision evidence

Schema v6 adds two fields to each session row, in JSON and NDJSON:

- `transcript_revision` is the archive's per-session counter, exported as a
  decimal string to preserve integer precision. Compare it numerically, not
  lexicographically. Within one archive's writer lineage, an identical
  transcript retains its counter through full resync; a changed transcript
  advances the previous counter once. The comparison includes persisted
  messages, tool calls, tool-result events, and message token usage. It does
  not export any of that content.
- `local_modified_at` is the stored local modification timestamp, or `null` when
  unavailable. It is not session activity time or measured working time.
  Transcript and standalone usage-event writes can update it while
  `last_activity_at` stays unchanged. It is a wall-clock signal: equal values,
  clock changes, and rebuilds prevent treating it as a monotonic revision.

For a materialized session receipt, retain a tuple of independent version
evidence: **transcript revision, project identity (or a digest of the complete
exported `project` reference), and pricing timestamp plus digest**. Also retain
`local_modified_at` for local metadata and standalone usage-event changes.
Project evidence can change without a transcript edit. Pricing evidence remains
page-level: `pricing.latest_row_updated_at` is the latest timestamp among the
effective pricing rows, and `pricing.digest` identifies their contents. An edit
to another pricing row need not advance that maximum, and removing the newest
row can lower it. Keep the digest even when timestamps match or are unavailable.

This is not a lexicographically ordered receipt version. A larger transcript
counter orders transcript changes, not concurrent project or pricing changes;
equal counters do not prove equal usage totals. Standalone `usage_events` and
session metadata are outside transcript equality. Digests establish equality,
not chronology. Do not use the transcript counter alone to reject or accept an
entire receipt, or compare counters from independently modified archive copies.

All fields are read with their session rows in the existing read transaction;
`--all` uses one transaction for all pages. Ordinary cursor pages remain
separate read transactions with the existing activity-based cursor checks, not a
revision-pinned historical snapshot. This addition does not change cursor
semantics or add a modified-since filter, durable checkpoint, or tombstones. A
future incremental export must cover every export-affecting writer, project and
pricing changes, cutoff ties, and journal resets before it can promise complete
change discovery. `--active-since` filters activity time and does not discover
all corrections to old sessions.

## Content Boundary

Session summary export omits transcript text, first-message text, thinking text,
tool input, tool output, and raw transcript bytes. It may include metadata that
came from sessions, such as sanitized project labels, branch names, model names,
token totals, and cost totals. It does not emit raw working-directory paths.

## Project Evidence

Each session row carries the project identity snapshot captured for that
session. `resolution` is `resolved`, `unknown`, or `ambiguous`; `identity`
appears only for resolved projects. `display_label` is presentation metadata and
is empty when no safe label is available. It is never used as an identity
fallback.

The nested `worktree.relationship` value is `main_worktree`, `linked_worktree`,
`not_a_worktree`, or `unknown`. `checkout.state` is `branch`, `detached`, or
`unknown`. A detached checkout can still belong to a main or linked worktree, so
consumers should treat checkout state and worktree relationship as independent
facts.

Remote-backed identities remain stable across checkout directory renames,
worktrees, branches, and machines. Machine-root identities are archive-scoped
and intentionally do not provide cross-machine continuity. Historical sessions
without captured evidence remain unknown rather than inferring identity from a
directory basename.

The report-level `projects` catalog uses the same identities, but remote-backed
catalog entries omit the session-specific `root_key`. See
[Project Identity](/docs/token-usage/#project-identity) for key prefixes,
normalization, shared-store scope, and privacy guarantees.

## Filters And Limits

`--limit` defaults to `db.MaxSessionLimit`, currently 500. The maximum accepted
value is also `db.MaxSessionLimit`, currently 500.

By default, export returns non-deleted root sessions, excludes one-shot
sessions, and excludes automated sessions. Use `--include-one-shot`,
`--include-automated`, and `--include-children` to widen that default. Default
exclusions can undercount token and cost totals when excluded sessions carry
usage.

When `--all --format json` is used, the command emits one JSON document with all
eligible sessions and an empty `cursor.next`. When `--all --format ndjson` is
used, the command emits one metadata line with an empty `cursor.next`, then all
eligible session rows. It does not concatenate multiple JSON documents.

## Cursor Contract

Pagination uses keyset cursors over a stable watermark. The first page mints a
watermark equal to the maximum eligible `last_activity_at` at cursor creation.
Later pages include only sessions whose `last_activity_at` is at or below that
watermark. The order is `last_activity_at DESC, id ASC`.

Sessions inserted after the first page with activity newer than the watermark
are excluded until a fresh export starts. The cursor also records a digest of
the full watermarked set and the already-emitted keyset prefix. If a later
request sees that rows have moved into or out of either digest, including an
unemitted row whose activity moved above the watermark, the command returns the
cursor-reset error so the caller can restart from a fresh first page. Rows
inserted mid-pagination under the watermark reset the cursor rather than being
quietly mixed into the in-flight run.

Every page reads its session rows, usage, pricing, project snapshots, worktree
observations, and archive metadata from one SQLite read transaction. Cursor
fingerprints cover membership and order across separate manual requests, not
every evidence field for that multi-request run. An evidence-only update between
manual requests does not force a reset; each returned page is nevertheless
internally snapshot-consistent. `--all` holds one read transaction across every
internal page, so the combined artifact has one pricing, identity, and usage
snapshot.

Because `--all` is explicitly unbounded, that read snapshot can delay WAL
checkpoint reclamation while concurrent sync writes continue. Cancellation
aborts the active queries and rolls back the transaction. Use ordinary bounded
pages for latency-sensitive polling; reserve `--all` for complete offline
artifacts.

The cursor embeds the archive `database_id`, filter parameters, ordering,
watermark, last keyset position, snapshot digest, prefix digest, and limit.
Passing `--cursor` with any query-affecting flag is an error. Only `--format`,
`--json`, and `--limit` may be used with `--cursor`; filters such as
`--project`, `--exclude-project`, `--machine`, `--git-branch`, `--agent`, date
filters, `--active-since`, message-count filters, `--include-one-shot`,
`--include-automated`, `--include-children`, `--outcome`, `--health-grade`,
`--min-tool-failures`, `--has-secret`, and `--all` may not.

If a cursor belongs to another archive or otherwise requires reset, stdout is
empty, stderr contains one JSON object, and the process exits with code 4:

```json
{"error":"cursor_reset","message":"session export cursor is no longer valid; restart the export","database_id":"00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001"}
```

Other usage and validation errors use the normal CLI error path and exit code 1.

## Daemonless Schema Eligibility

The command normally keeps the archive read-only. If read-only open reports a
typed missing-schema error for `archive_metadata`,
`project_identity_observations`, or `session_project_identity_snapshots`, the
command may create a missing one of those tables, or add an explicitly supported
column to an existing observation table, in one transaction and then reopen
read-only. Existing metadata or snapshot tables with missing columns are not
eligible. It does not initialize unrelated tables, run data repairs, or
reclassify sessions. Other missing core schema still requires the normal
writable daemon migration or full resync.

When an older archive lacks per-session identity snapshots, the writable daemon
reconstructs them in a resumable background migration. This reconstruction is
best-effort: it combines stored session metadata with the repository and Git
configuration visible when the migration runs, so a repository that moved or
changed remotes may not reproduce its original checkout context. Existing stored
snapshots remain authoritative. `agentsview export status` reports pending,
running, failed, and completed state; failed status includes the last recorded
error.

## Versioning

`agentsview export sessions --format json|ndjson` is its own versioned surface.
Its v1 shape shipped in 0.37.1. Releases 0.38.0 and 0.38.1 introduced the
current privacy-bounded project, repository, worktree, and checkout evidence
shape but mistakenly continued to report version 1. Current builds report
version 6. Version 2 corrected the project-evidence marker, version 3 introduced
exact microdollar money objects, and version 4 adds explicit
reported-to-priced-model resolutions with complete request-pricing bands and
application counts. Version 5 selects complete Claude snapshots before generic
deduplication across pagination and session filters, retains earliest-session
attribution, and includes the maximum observed web-search count in pricing.
Version 6 applies provider-specific billing identity to computed usage and
preserves reported cost rows and custom pricing overrides. Costs from v5 and v6
must not be compared as the same billing semantics. Publishing `archive_id` is
an additive v6 extension: existing session IDs, database IDs, usage, pricing,
ordering, and cursor semantics are unchanged. The two transitional releases must
not be treated as v1-compatible. There is no flag to request an earlier output
version. Additive fields do not require a bump, but row semantic changes, field
type changes, sort order changes, cursor semantics changes, required-field
meaning changes, field removal, pricing digest canonicalization changes, project
key derivation changes, remote normalization changes, path fallback
normalization changes, and new closed-enum values require a bump.

Consumers should require the expected `schema_version` and ignore unknown
additive fields.

Closed enums established in version 2 and unchanged in version 6 include project
`resolution` (`resolved`, `unknown`, `ambiguous`), session `classification`
(`interactive`, `automated`), and `cost_source` (`computed`, `reported`,
`mixed`).

title: Token Usage & Costs
description: Fast token usage and cost reports from your local AgentsView database
---

AgentsView records token usage while ingesting messages and usage events from
agents that write model and token metadata to their local logs. The database
already knows the input, output, cache-creation, and cache-read tokens those
agents have logged, and the `agentsview usage` commands turn that into daily
cost reports and a one-line today's-spend summary without re-reading source
files. To see that same cost attributed to specific time ranges and concurrent
agent activity, see the [Activity](/docs/activity/) dashboard.

If you've used [`ccusage`](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage) this will feel
familiar. AgentsView covers the same core job — "how much did I spend on AI
coding yesterday?" — across multiple coding agents from one archive.

!!! warning "Experimental"

    Token usage and cost reporting is a newer area of AgentsView and is still
    maturing. The Usage dashboard and the `agentsview usage` CLI may have rough
    edges, especially around agents whose parsers were recently taught to emit token
    counts. Bug reports and feature requests are very welcome — please
    [open an issue](https://github.com/kenn-io/agentsview/issues).

## Agent Coverage

!!! note

    Usage totals are populated when the source session includes token metadata for
    **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Copilot CLI**, **OpenCode** and OpenCode-format
    forks such as **IcodeMate**, **Kilo**, and **MiMoCode**, **Cursor IDE**, **Posit
    Assistant**, **Pi**, **Prime Agent**, **Gemini**, **Qwen Code**, **OpenClaw**,
    **QClaw**, **Hermes**, **WorkBuddy**, **Forge**, **Piebald**, **Antigravity
    IDE/CLI**, **Zed**, **VS Code Copilot**, **Visual Studio Copilot**, **Mistral
    Vibe**, **gptme**, and **Amp**. Version 0.44.0 also adds coverage for **Cline
    CLI**, **Tencent CodeBuddy CN**, **Augure Code**, **Augure Desktop 3 beta**, and
    **Charm Crush**, and reads **DeepSeek Harness** formats through version 3.

    Coverage depends on what each agent records. AgentsView uses recorded costs
    when available; otherwise it estimates cost from usable token counts and a
    model that can be priced. Sessions still appear in the browser, search, and
    analytics when their logs do not expose usage. Warp records session-level
    totals, but those totals are not yet folded into the per-message cost report.

Crush contributes recorded session totals and cost, with no per-message token or
cache breakdown. Its aggregate usage is attributed to the most recent assistant
model, so it does not provide a model-by-model account of a session that
switched models.

Augure Code and Augure Desktop retain recorded usage. Proprietary Augure models
have no catalog price, so token-based cost estimates remain unpriced unless you
add [custom model pricing](#custom-model-pricing). Recorded authoritative costs
are retained when the source provides them.

When an agent filter selects only agents that do not expose per-message token
rows, AgentsView reports that as an unsupported usage state instead of silently
showing an empty chart. Copilot-family filters (`copilot`, `vscode-copilot`, and
`visualstudio-copilot`) keep Copilot-specific wording; any other no-token agent
falls back to a generic "matching sessions do not expose token usage data"
message. AI-credit cost denomination (surfaced as "Copilot AI Credits" for
Copilot agents) is tracked as a separate capability from no-token-data, so
future agents can opt into either behavior independently.

### Cursor Admin Usage Events

Cursor has two usage sources in AgentsView:

- local Cursor transcripts, when `~/.cursor/projects` contains usable token
  metadata
- Cursor Admin API usage events, imported on demand with
  `agentsview usage cursor`

The admin import is useful when you want billable team usage from Cursor itself,
including headless/background events that may not map cleanly to a local
transcript. Configure an API key in `~/.agentsview/config.toml` or the
environment, then run:

```toml
cursor_admin_api_key = "key_xxxxx"
cursor_admin_email = "you@example.com" # optional default filter
cursor_admin_user_id = "152683922"     # optional default filter
```

```bash
# Import the last 30 days
agentsview usage cursor

# Import a specific inclusive local-date window
agentsview usage cursor --since 2026-05-01 --until 2026-05-31

# Import everything Cursor returns for this admin key/filter
agentsview usage cursor --all
```

The command calls Cursor's filtered usage-events endpoint, follows pagination,
stores the returned rows in the local archive, and deduplicates rows by a stable
event fingerprint. It is safe to rerun the same window after new events arrive.

Imported admin rows are folded into the Usage dashboard,
`agentsview usage daily`, DuckDB mirrors, and PostgreSQL after the usual
push/sync path. They appear as `agent = cursor`; because Cursor Admin events are
account-level billing rows rather than session transcripts, project, machine,
session-count, and top-session filters do not apply to those rows. Model and
date filters do apply.

Costs for admin rows come from Cursor's `chargedCents` field instead of
AgentsView's model-pricing table, so they can report spend even for models that
do not have a LiteLLM price entry.

## Usage Dashboard

AgentsView includes a dedicated **Usage** page in the web UI, reachable from the
**Usage** button in the header or directly at `/usage`. It's a focused view of
cost and token totals, driven by the same data the CLI commands read.

![Token usage dashboard](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/usage-page.png)

The page is built around four panels: summary cards, a cost trend over time, a
cost attribution treemap, and a bottom grid with top sessions by cost and a
cache efficiency breakdown.

In 0.23.0, the page also picks up a few workflow improvements:

- the page refreshes automatically on new sync data in normal `agentsview serve`
  mode
- the `Project | Model | Agent` selector is shared between the cost chart and
  the attribution panel
- active filters are preserved when switching between the **Sessions** and
  **Usage** tabs
- the top-cost sessions table now shows session names instead of only IDs or
  message previews where available

### Filters & Date Range

The toolbar at the top of the page scopes the entire dashboard. Pick a start and
end date with the date inputs, or narrow down with the Project, Agent, and Model
filter dropdowns. Usage opens to a rolling 30-day range. Linking its date
selection to other date-aware pages is optional. Turn it on with **Settings >
Date ranges > Link date ranges across pages**. Filter state is written back to
the URL — copying the address bar gives you a shareable link to the exact view
you're looking at. A **Clear filters** link appears next to the refresh button
when anything is active.

Switch the toolbar metric from **Cost** to **Tokens** to analyze token volume.
The token-type multi-select scopes token totals, trends, attribution,
comparisons, and top-session ranking to any combination of **Input**, **Cache
Writes**, **Cached Read**, and **Output**. All four are selected by default.
Token-type selections are also written to the URL, so an Output-only project or
session ranking can be shared directly.

Project-key exclusions are the exception. Shared-store project keys are scoped
to the current aggregate archive set, so the page keeps those exclusions in
memory and does not write or restore them through the URL.

![Usage toolbar with filters](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/usage-toolbar.png)

Each filter dropdown supports multi-select with a search box, Select all /
Deselect all shortcuts, and a colored dot for agents so you can tell them apart
at a glance.

In the Model picker, checked models are visible and unchecked models are
hidden. Clicking a model in the attribution chart unchecks it in the picker.
Recheck it to show it again without changing the other models. Hidden models
remain in the picker after a reload or when opening a shared URL.

Usage saves model visibility with `exclude_model`. The previous Usage-only
`model` URL parameter and saved inclusion selections no longer restrict the
view; choose hidden models in the picker instead. The Analytics model filter
and API model filters are unchanged.

![Model filter dropdown](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/usage-filter-dropdown.png)

### Summary Cards

Eight baseline cards at the top summarize the selected window. The Total Cost
card is featured with a larger value; the rest show total tokens, daily burn,
peak day, cache hit rate, project and model counts, and active days. When
Copilot-family sessions have priced usage, an additional **Copilot AI Credits**
card shows the same spend converted at 100 credits per dollar.

![Usage summary cards](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/usage-summary-cards.png)

### Cost Over Time

A stacked chart shows cost per day across the range, grouped by project, model,
or agent — toggle the grouping with the segment buttons in the panel header.
Each series is colored consistently with the attribution panel below so you can
cross-reference them.

![Cost over time chart](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/usage-cost-trend.png)

### Cost Attribution

The attribution panel breaks down total spend for the window into a treemap plus
a ranked side rail. Switch the group-by between **Project**, **Model**, and
**Agent**, or flip the view from **Treemap** to **List** for a table-style
readout. Click any cell (or row) to hide it from the chart above, which is the
primary drill-down mechanic — hide the obvious outliers and the remaining
breakdown tells you where the smaller spend is going.

![Cost attribution treemap](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/usage-attribution.png)

### Pairwise Cost Comparison

The Usage page also includes **Comparative Cost Analysis** for side-by-side cost
checks. Pick a dimension (**Project** or **Model**) and value for the left side,
then pick the same or a different dimension and value for the right side. The
comparison uses the page's active date range and shared filters, then asks the
backend to compute both slices.

The result table shows total cost, session count, cost per session, total
tokens, tokens per session, input tokens, output tokens, the absolute delta from
left to right, and the percent delta when a ratio can be computed. It is useful
for questions such as "how much more expensive was project A than project B this
week?" or "how do two models compare after normalizing by session count?"

The same comparison is available over REST:

```http
GET /api/v1/usage/pairwise-comparison
```

Pass the normal usage filters plus `left_dimension`, `left_value`,
`right_dimension`, and `right_value`. Supported dimensions are `project` and
`model`. Branch-scoped comparisons use the shared `git_branch` usage filter with
an opaque token from `GET /api/v1/branches`.

### Top Sessions by Cost

A ranked list of the most expensive sessions in the window, with the agent pill,
session name, project, token total, and cost. Click any row to jump straight to
that session in the message viewer.

![Top sessions by cost](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/usage-top-sessions.png)

### Cache Efficiency

A stacked bar breakdown of cache reads, cache writes, uncached input tokens, and
output tokens, plus a savings callout showing how much you saved (or overspent)
versus a no-cache baseline. Useful for spotting prompts that are blowing through
cache creation without earning the reads back.

![Cache efficiency panel](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/usage-cache-efficiency.png)

The dashboard reads from the same `model_pricing` table that backs the CLI
commands below, so the numbers line up exactly with what
`agentsview usage daily` prints.

### PostgreSQL-Backed Usage

As of 0.23.0, the Usage page and usage API also work when the UI is served from
PostgreSQL via [`agentsview pg serve`](/docs/pg-sync/). That means shared or
multi-machine deployments can browse the same cost and token dashboards without
relying on a local SQLite archive.

The live SSE refresh path is still specific to the normal local `serve` runtime.
`pg serve` is read-only and does not expose the global live event stream.

## Quick Tour

```bash
# Last 30 days of spend as a terminal table
agentsview usage daily

# Full history, with per-model breakdown rows
agentsview usage daily --all --breakdown

# JSON output for scripting
agentsview usage daily --json > spend.json

```

```

The daily table shows input, output, cache-creation, and cache-read token totals
per local-time day, the estimated cost, and the models that contributed to each
row. Adding `--breakdown` prints indented per-model sub-rows so you can see
which model drove the spend on each day. In JSON output, the same flag also
populates per-project, per-agent, and per-machine breakdown arrays for every
day, making costs from shared multi-machine archives separable without another
query.

On large archives, aggregate usage reads are served from a local cache of daily
totals that stays exact as sessions sync. The first query after an install,
upgrade, or cache deletion is slower while that cache builds; subsequent queries
are fast.

## How Costs Are Computed

Every message parsed from a session file stores its raw `token_usage` JSON
(input, output, cache creation, cache read) and the model name reported by the
agent. The usage command:

1. Loads `model_pricing` and its `model_pricing_bands` children into memory once
   per invocation. They hold base per-million-token rates and any
   whole-request input thresholds published by the pricing catalog.
1. Scans `messages` filtered by the requested date range and agent, parsing each
   row's `token_usage` blob in Go with `gjson` — faster than SQLite's per-row
   `json_extract`.
1. Selects the applicable complete rate tuple for each request, multiplies that
   row's tokens by the selected rates, then buckets and aggregates the result.

Message usage and usage events tied to a `message_ordinal` represent individual
requests. For those rows, AgentsView adds uncached input, cache creation, and
cache-read input, then selects the highest catalog band whose threshold is
strictly below that total. Exactly 272,000 tokens therefore retain a 272K base
rate while 272,001 select its band. Unbound usage events may summarize several
requests, so they conservatively use the base rate instead of applying a
threshold to an aggregate.

The default window is the last 30 days; pass `--all` to scan the full history.

!!! note

    AgentsView does not mint usage events on your behalf. It can only report token
    usage that the agent wrote to its own session files. Agents that don't emit
    token counts (or that strip them from local logs) won't show up.

### Pricing Source

Model rates come from the
[LiteLLM model pricing catalog](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm), with the
[OpenRouter model catalog](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api/api-reference/models/get-models)
layered underneath for models LiteLLM does not list. Both are fetched together
(hourly at most on `usage` invocations, daily by the server) and merged into the
`model_pricing` table; when both catalogs list a model, LiteLLM's rate wins, and
an OpenRouter row is dropped once LiteLLM picks the model up. If the LiteLLM
fetch fails, AgentsView keeps the last stored rates; if only the OpenRouter
fetch fails, the fresh LiteLLM rates are still stored and the stored OpenRouter
rates are kept. Fresh databases are seeded from an embedded LiteLLM snapshot so
offline use works before any refresh completes. Pass `--offline` to skip the
fetch entirely and always use the embedded fallback.

The embedded fallback is updated with AgentsView releases, so the numbers are as
current as your installed version. For up-to-the-minute rates, leave `--offline`
off.

LiteLLM's standard whole-request 200K and 272K token rates are preserved in both
fetched and embedded catalogs. Processing variants such as Batch, Flex,
Priority, regional, and one-hour cache pricing are not inferred when the stored
usage does not identify that service tier.

### Anthropic Web Search Fee

Anthropic charges a flat
\[$10 per 1,000 server-side web search requests](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool)
on top of tokens. That fee is not a per-token rate, so it lives outside the
`model_pricing` catalog as a fixed $0.01 per request. AgentsView adds it to any
usage row whose stored `token_usage` reports
`server_tool_use.web_search_requests`, and `session usage --format json` reports
the per-row count as `web_search_requests` so the charge is auditable. A row
that carries an authoritative reported cost is left alone, since that cost
already settles the whole row.

Claude Code runs each `WebSearch` in an out-of-band side call and writes a zero
counter on the assistant message, so AgentsView takes the count from the linked
tool result instead. That side call's own tokens — tens of thousands of input
tokens on a Haiku model per search — are not written to the transcript at all
and are therefore a known undercount: AgentsView records the fee, not the hidden
tokens.

As of 0.32.0, the embedded fallback includes `claude-opus-4-7` at the same Opus
tier used for 4.6 and 4.8, so offline reports and fresh installs price Opus 4.7
sessions without waiting for a live LiteLLM fetch. 0.33.0 adds `claude-fable-5`
at its launch rates ($10 input, $50 output, $12.50 cache creation, $1 cache read
per million tokens).

### Custom Model Pricing

As of 0.24.0, you can supply per-million-token rates for models that aren't in
the LiteLLM catalog, or override the catalog's rates for models that are. Add
`[custom_model_pricing.<model>]` tables to `~/.agentsview/config.toml`:

```toml
[custom_model_pricing."acme-ultra-2.1"]
input_microdollars_per_mtok = 2_000_000
output_microdollars_per_mtok = 8_000_000
cache_creation_microdollars_per_mtok = 2_500_000
cache_read_microdollars_per_mtok = 200_000

[custom_model_pricing.internal-tiny]
input_microdollars_per_mtok = 200_000
output_microdollars_per_mtok = 800_000
```

| Field                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `input_microdollars_per_mtok`             | Integer microdollars per million input tokens (defaults to `0` if omitted)                                                                                  |
| `output_microdollars_per_mtok`            | Integer microdollars per million output tokens (defaults to `0` if omitted)                                                                                 |
| `cache_creation_microdollars_per_mtok`    | Integer microdollars per million cache-creation tokens (optional)                                                                                           |
| `cache_creation_1h_microdollars_per_mtok` | Integer microdollars per million 1-hour-TTL cache-creation tokens (optional; when omitted or `0`, 1h writes bill at `cache_creation_microdollars_per_mtok`) |
| `cache_read_microdollars_per_mtok`        | Integer microdollars per million cache-read tokens (optional)                                                                                               |

The table key is the model name as it appears in your session data (match the
string the agent itself writes, dots and all — quote the key if it contains
special characters). Custom rates take precedence over LiteLLM, OpenRouter, and
the embedded fallback, and apply to the Usage dashboard, the `agentsview usage`
CLI, and `pg serve` alike. A custom entry replaces the full rate row for that
model, so omitted fields are treated as zero rather than falling through to
another catalog. A custom row is flat and suppresses any fetched request bands
for that model. Models without a custom entry continue to resolve through the
stored catalog.

### Posit Assistant Billing

For usage rows whose stored provider ID is exactly `positai`, AgentsView
estimates computed token costs and cache savings at 110% of the selected catalog
rates. Model, timestamp, and request-band selection happen before the
adjustment. Rows with empty or other provider IDs — including observed
`anthropic` bring-your-own-provider rows in the same session — use base rates.

Custom pricing overrides are not adjusted. Explicit reported costs remain
authoritative, and fixed web-search fees remain at their published face value.

### Copilot CLI Token Metrics

As of 0.32.0, Copilot CLI sessions contribute to usage and cost reports.
AgentsView reads per-message assistant output tokens from
`assistant.message.outputTokens`, then reads model-level session totals from
`session.shutdown.modelMetrics`. When Copilot has not written a usable shutdown
summary, known per-message output tokens still appear in usage reports. That
partial fallback cannot report input, cache, reasoning, or Copilot AI Credit
totals. Fresh input tokens are computed as total input minus cache reads and
cache writes; cache writes map to cache-creation tokens, and cache reads map to
cache-read tokens. Copilot's Claude model IDs use dotted version numbers, so the
parser normalizes names such as `claude-sonnet-4.6` to `claude-sonnet-4-6`
before pricing lookup.

For sessions starting June 1, 2026 or later, available per-call usage from
`session-store.db` supplies input, output, cache, and reasoning counts before
shutdown. Store updates refresh the affected sessions without rereading
unchanged transcripts. Overlapping transcript output contributes only its
positive per-model difference from store totals; missing input cannot be
reconstructed. Store tokens use catalog estimates, while the latest shutdown
reported cost retains the treatment described below.

Upgrading to 0.32.0 bumps the parser data version so existing Copilot CLI
sessions are re-indexed with the new usage rows.

Some Copilot CLI records include `session.shutdown.modelMetrics` totals but omit
per-message `assistant.message.outputTokens`. AgentsView can still use the
aggregate model totals where they are complete, but it cannot reconstruct
per-message output-token rows from those records. As of 0.35.1, the CLI reports
that limitation directly instead of implying that the session has no usage data
at all.

### VS Code Copilot Token Metrics

As of 0.34.0, VS Code Copilot chat sessions also contribute when their persisted
request metadata includes token counts. AgentsView reads `promptTokens`,
`outputTokens`, and the resolved model from the session payload. VS Code reports
prompt tokens as a single total, so AgentsView treats them as input tokens;
prompt-cache discounts are not split out unless the source log exposes them
separately.

Upgrading to 0.34.0 re-indexes existing VS Code Copilot sessions so historical
chats pick up the newly available usage rows.

### Visual Studio Copilot Token Metrics

As of 0.34.0, Visual Studio Copilot traces also contribute when OpenTelemetry
spans include `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`, and
model attributes. AgentsView deduplicates repeated trace flushes for the same
chat turn and keeps the copy with the most complete token usage before pricing
it.

### Copilot Reported Billing

Copilot CLI `session.shutdown` events can include a `totalNanoAiu` billing
total. Copilot sessions starting on or after June 1, 2026 can report an
authoritative `totalNanoAiu` billing total. Older sessions remain catalog-priced
because they were created under the premium-request pricing model. AgentsView
converts that cumulative amount exactly (`totalNanoAiu / 1e11` USD) and stores
the session-level value through the normal reported-cost fields, on one stable
usage-event row. Later shutdowns supersede earlier totals, including an
authoritative final zero.

When the selected data contains this reported session cost, AgentsView
suppresses every catalog-priced estimate for that session. This prevents double
counting across models, days, and resumed segments. Historical Copilot sessions
without `totalNanoAiu` and other Copilot-family agents retain catalog pricing.

For unfiltered reports, AgentsView allocates the session total across the
selected usage rows in proportion to their catalog-price estimates. This keeps
per-day and per-model breakdowns additive: their costs sum to the displayed
session or report total. In a multi-model session those model costs are
estimated attributions; Copilot reports only the session total, not a charge per
model.

A date window containing only rows before the reported settlement can still show
catalog estimates because the later session total is outside the selected data.
Model-filtered reports also remain catalog estimates because applying the whole
session total to one selected model would overstate that model.

### Copilot AI Credits

Usage reports compute **Copilot AI Credits** for Copilot-family agents
(`copilot`, `vscode-copilot`, and `visualstudio-copilot`) when their usage rows
have a complete cost. The conversion is cost divided by `$0.01`, matching the
unit AgentsView uses for Copilot credit reporting. When a session carries an
authoritative Copilot-reported cost, the credits derive from that reported
total; otherwise they derive from the catalog estimate. The Usage dashboard
shows this as an optional summary card, and `agentsview session usage` prints an
`AI Credits` line for priced Copilot-family sessions. Usage report totals
continue to expose the same `copilotAICredits` field.

### Claude Streaming & Codex Token Events

The 0.20.0 cost tracking release also improved how raw token usage is extracted
so the input side of the equation is accurate:

- **Claude Code:** streaming deltas previously wrote the same token counts
  multiple times, roughly doubling input totals. The parser now deduplicates
  them.
- **Codex:** per-request `token_count` events embedded in `event_msg` entries
  are now captured, so Codex sessions have populated token usage where they
  previously reported zero.

If you upgraded from an earlier version, the first `usage` invocation triggers a
full resync so these corrections apply to historical sessions.

### Amp Token Metrics

Amp thread documents carry a `usage` object on each assistant message with the
model and its input, output, cache-creation, and cache-read token counts.
AgentsView reads them per inference, so a thread that switches models keeps each
model's own tokens rather than collapsing to one.

Amp routes every prompt token into one of three input buckets. Anthropic-backed
threads already use Anthropic's cache semantics and are read as-is.
OpenAI-backed threads report `inputTokens` as zero and classify the whole
uncached prompt as cache creation; because OpenAI does not bill cache writes,
those tokens are recorded as uncached input and no cache-creation bucket is
emitted — the same normalization the Codex parser applies for the same reason.

Two limits are worth knowing. Older threads can omit the model entirely. Usage
reporting counts only rows that carry a model, so those inferences are absent
from daily totals and model breakdowns rather than appearing at a guessed rate —
their tokens are still stored and visible in the session's own usage view. And
Amp's exports record only main-thread inference, so tokens spent by `oracle`,
`librarian`, and other subagents are not included in a thread's totals.

Note that recent Amp versions keep complete threads server-side and leave only
stub files on disk. AgentsView reports usage for whatever complete threads are
present locally; threads that exist only as stubs have nothing to read.

## Reporting Model

`agentsview usage` reads token and cost facts from the same SQLite archive as
the UI, then joins them with the applicable pricing data.

Version 0.42.0 also keeps an exact daily rollup cache for repeated reports. The
cache is disposable rather than authoritative: AgentsView rebuilds any missing
or stale day from the archived usage rows before returning it. The reporting
workflow also:

- **Works beyond Claude Code** — coverage includes Claude Code, Codex, Copilot
  CLI, OpenCode-format tools, Pi, Prime Agent, Gemini, Qwen Code,
  OpenClaw/QClaw, Hermes, WorkBuddy, Forge, Piebald, Antigravity, Zed, VS Code
  Copilot, Visual Studio Copilot, Mistral Vibe, and gptme from the same
  database and command whenever those sessions log token metadata. Filter with
  `--agent <name>` when you want a single-agent view.
- **Shares one database with the UI** — the same data powers
  [Analytics](/docs/usage/#dashboard) and session detail views, so there's no
  second index to keep fresh.
- **Reads committed archive data** — daily reports can run while the daemon
  imports new source changes. Run `agentsview sync` first when those changes
  must be included. Session usage and statusline finish any pending startup
  ingestion before querying, including when they reuse an existing daemon.

## `agentsview usage daily`

Daily cost report. Outputs a tab-aligned table to stdout by default, or JSON
with `--format json` (or the `--json` alias).

A cold cache prepares the sessions needed for the report. Slow reports print
preparation phases and elapsed time to stderr, including with JSON output. Usage
reports can finish beyond the server's normal write timeout. Press Ctrl+C to
stop waiting; shared cache preparation can continue in the daemon. Canceling
daemon startup also leaves the detached child running.

Required archive reparsing finishes before the daemon serves requests. Startup
waits show phases and continue while progress updates arrive, including when a
foreground server is starting in another terminal. Restart older daemons after
upgrading to provide the usage progress endpoint.

```bash
agentsview usage daily [flags]

| `--timezone`  | system        | IANA timezone name used for date bucketing                               |

The default 30-day window only kicks in when neither `--since` nor `--until` nor
`--all` is given. Passing just `--until` leaves the start open so "everything up
to X" still works.

`modelsUsed` is sorted by cost within each day, so the most expensive model
appears first. Daily entries always emit `modelBreakdowns`, `projectBreakdowns`,
`agentBreakdowns`, and `machineBreakdowns` as arrays; empty breakdowns are `[]`,
not omitted. `modelBreakdowns` always includes a row per model. The other three
arrays are populated when `--breakdown` is passed; the flag also controls
per-model terminal table output. With `--breakdown`, `machine_labels` maps each
`machineBreakdowns[].machineName` key to its display label and contains only
keys present in the report. The map is `{}` when
the archive has no labels or the catalog read fails; failures produce a warning
on stderr while the report continues. Without `--breakdown`, the field is
omitted and the command does not read the catalog. Adding this field does not
change `schema_version`.

### JSON Contract

`agentsview usage daily --json` is a versioned JSON surface. The Usage daily
JSON, Activity report JSON, and session summary export JSON/NDJSON are separate
versioned surfaces, so a future bump in one does not imply a bump in the others.
Usage and activity already emitted `schema_version: 1` before 0.38, and the
session-summary v1 contract shipped in 0.37.1. Releases 0.38.0 and 0.38.1
emitted the substantially revised project-evidence shape while still reporting
version 1. Version 2 corrected those markers, version 3 introduced exact
microdollar money objects, and version 4 adds resolved-model pricing provenance
with request-pricing bands and application counts. Version 5 selects complete
Claude snapshots before generic deduplication and charges the maximum observed
server-side web-search count. Versions 4 and 5 are contract bumps because
version 4 changed band-selection pricing semantics and digest canonicalization,
while version 5 changes snapshot and server-tool accounting. Version 6 applies
provider-specific billing identity to computed usage and preserves reported
costs and custom pricing overrides; consumers must not treat v5 and v6 costs as
interchangeable. The two transitional releases must not be treated as
v1-compatible. The commands do not provide an earlier-version output mode.
Consumers should require the expected `schema_version` and ignore unknown
additive fields.

Additive fields may appear in future compatible payloads. Consumers should
ignore unknown keys.

### Pricing Provenance

Versioned usage, activity, and session-export payloads include a report-level
`pricing` block. `pricing.models` is nested under that block and is keyed by the
distinct model names reported in payload rows, not by canonical pricing names or
every row in the pricing table. Each reported-model entry has an aggregate
`cost_source` and a `resolutions` array. A resolution reports `priced_model`,
`matched_pattern`, `input_cost_per_mtok`, `output_cost_per_mtok`,
`cache_write_cost_per_mtok`, `cache_write_1h_cost_per_mtok`,
`cache_read_cost_per_mtok`, `cost_source`, `bands`, and `application`.
`cache_write_1h_cost_per_mtok` is the 1-hour-TTL cache-write rate; zero means
the catalog publishes no separate 1h rate and 1h writes bill at
`cache_write_cost_per_mtok`. Resolutions are sorted by `priced_model` and then
`matched_pattern`.

Each `bands` item is a complete rate tuple with an exclusive
`above_input_tokens` threshold. `application` reports how computed rows in this
payload used those rates:

- `base_request_count` counts request-scoped rows that selected no band.
- `aggregate_row_count` counts unbound aggregate rows forced to base rates.
- `bands` lists each selected threshold and its `request_count`.

Reported-only rows do not increment application counts. These counts preserve
the difference between one above-threshold request and several smaller requests
after their tokens and costs have been aggregated.

When no catalog bands or applied bands exist, their canonical JSON value is
`null`, not `[]`. Consumers should accept future additive fields but can rely on
that null-versus-nonempty-array representation within schema version 5.

Ordinary models have one resolution whose `priced_model` is the reported model.
Fixed aliases such as `k2d6-agent` and `gpt-reserve` keep that reported name
and resolve `priced_model` to a catalog row (`moonshot/kimi-k2.6` and
`gpt-5.6-luna`). Timestamp-aware aliases can have more than one resolution in a
report. For
example, one `kimi-for-coding` entry can contain both `moonshot/kimi-k2.6` and
`kimi-k3` resolutions when its rows span the pricing cutoff. An exact
custom-pricing row for the reported alias takes precedence before timestamp
canonicalization and produces one self-resolution. Fallback provenance also
lists reported model names.

`cost_source` is a closed enum everywhere it appears: `computed`, `reported`, or
`mixed`. It was established in schema version 2 and is unchanged in version 5.
`computed` means AgentsView derived cost from token counts and the effective
pricing resolver. `reported` means a source supplied explicit cost, such as
Cursor Admin API billing data; those amounts may not be derivable from tokens
times rates. `mixed` means the enclosing report, reported-model entry, or rollup
contains both provenance kinds. Each resolution carries its own source, while
the reported-model entry aggregates its resolutions. For computed costs,
reasoning tokens are priced at the output-token rate.

An authoritative session total is never added to that session's computed
estimate. It replaces the estimate completely. A report-level pricing block can
still be `mixed` when it records that authoritative settlement alongside
computed per-model attribution. Those model allocations are estimates derived
from catalog-cost weights and sum to the reported total. A multi-session rollup
can also be `mixed` when different sessions use different sources.

If a source reports an amount for a model with no matching effective pricing
row, its model entry and resolution have `cost_source: "reported"`, the
resolution has `matched_pattern: null`, and all four rate fields are zero. The
reported amount remains authoritative; the zero rates express unavailable rate
provenance, not a zero-rate calculation.

`pricing.source` is one of `embedded`, `fetched`, `custom`, `custom+embedded`,
or `custom+fetched`. Combined values always serialize `custom` first, followed
by the base table ingredient. `pricing.table_version` is the embedded fallback
snapshot version for embedded base tables, the latest fetched row timestamp for
fetched base tables, and `custom` for custom-only effective tables.
`pricing.digest` is independently recomputable as RFC 8785-style canonical JSON
hashed with SHA-256 and prefixed with `sha256:`. The digest input is exactly a
`{"rows":[...]}` object. Rows are sorted by `model_pattern` bytewise ascending,
then row `source`, the four rate fields, and `updated_at`; each row contains
exactly `model_pattern`, `input_per_mtok`, `output_per_mtok`,
`cache_write_per_mtok`, `cache_read_per_mtok`, `source`, `updated_at`, and
`bands`. Bands are sorted by `above_input_tokens`; each canonical band contains
exactly `above_input_tokens`, `input_per_mtok`, `output_per_mtok`,
`cache_write_per_mtok`, `cache_read_per_mtok`, and `updated_at`. Application
counts describe one report and are deliberately excluded from the catalog
digest. `updated_at` is `null` or a UTC RFC3339 timestamp such as
`2026-07-03T12:00:00Z`. Digest canonicalization errors fail the export instead
of emitting an empty digest. The digest uses the resolver's internal canonical
pricing-row keys; the public `pricing.models` block uses the `*_cost_per_mtok`
field names shown above. The reported-to-priced resolution mapping is not part
of the pricing-table digest.

### Project Identity

Versioned usage, activity, and session-export payloads include a report-level
`projects` catalog keyed by opaque `project_key` values prefixed with
`pl1:sha256:`. Project-bearing rows use the same key. Catalog entries contain a
presentation-only `display_label`, an explicit `resolution`, and `identity` only
when resolution succeeds.

Resolved identities prefer remote-backed keys. Local `file://` and bare-path
remotes are ignored for key derivation because they are machine-local. If no
usable network remote resolves, AgentsView falls back to a normalized root path
and emits identity `kind` as `machine_root`. Path-backed keys are useful within
one archive or machine, but consumers should not expect them to join across
machines.

Canonical project keys use `p1:sha256:`; repository, root, and worktree keys use
`repo1:sha256:`, `r1:sha256:`, and `wt1:sha256:`. Network remotes are normalized
after credentials, scheme, query, fragment, default port, and `.git` suffix are
removed. Absolute paths, raw remotes, and credentials do not cross the export
boundary. Remote-backed catalog identities omit machine-local `root_key`;
session rows retain their own complete root, worktree, and checkout facts.

SQLite catalog keys are archive-scoped. Shared PostgreSQL and DuckDB dashboard
responses may aggregate archives, so their catalog keys are response-scoped and
must not be persisted as durable selectors. The canonical `identity.key`, not
the display label or catalog key, represents project continuity.

## `agentsview usage statusline`

One-line today's spend, designed for shell prompts, tmux status lines, and
window titles. Statusline has a 30-second deadline covering startup and the
report request; it returns an error if that deadline expires.

| `--no-sync` | `false` | Skip source refresh                              |

Output is a single line:

```
$9.61 today
```

With `--agent claude`:

```
$6.42 today (claude)
```

With `--json`, the same facts are emitted for scripts, with the cost as exact
microdollars rather than a formatted string:

```json
{
  "date": "2026-08-04",
  "cost": {
    "microdollars": 9610000
  }
}
```

`agent` is included when `--agent` filtered the query.

The command always scopes to the current local-time day. Use
`agentsview usage daily --since $(date +%Y-%m-%d)` if you want the full row
instead.

## `agentsview usage cursor`

Import Cursor Admin API usage events into the local archive so they contribute
to the Usage dashboard and daily reports.

```bash
agentsview usage cursor [flags]
```

| Flag          | Default       | Description                                              |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--since`     | `30 days ago` | Start date (`YYYY-MM-DD`), inclusive                     |
| `--until`     | today         | End date (`YYYY-MM-DD`), inclusive                       |
| `--all`       | `false`       | Include all history; overrides the default 30-day window |
| `--page-size` | `100`         | Cursor Admin API events requested per page               |
| `--email`     | config        | Filter by Cursor team member email                       |
| `--user-id`   | config        | Filter by Cursor team member user ID                     |

The API key is required and can be supplied as `cursor_admin_api_key` in
`~/.agentsview/config.toml` or as `AGENTSVIEW_CURSOR_ADMIN_API_KEY`. Optional
default member filters can be supplied with `cursor_admin_email` /
`cursor_admin_user_id` or their matching environment variables.

### Example: Starship Prompt Module

```toml
# ~/.config/starship.toml
[custom.agentsview]
command = "agentsview usage statusline --offline --no-sync"
when = "true"
format = "[$output]($style) "
style = "bold green"
```

The offline flags read the existing archive without starting a daemon or syncing
source files. A separate `agentsview serve` process or periodic
`agentsview sync` keeps the archive fresh. Cache preparation can still take
time.

## Source Freshness

`usage daily` reads committed archive data. When it starts a daemon, routine
source ingestion runs after readiness. Run `agentsview sync` before the report
when it must include new source changes. Required archive reparsing still
finishes before the daemon serves requests.

`session usage`, `token-use`, and `usage statusline` complete pending startup
ingestion before querying. This also applies when a previous daily report
started the daemon. Once startup ingestion is complete, subsequent queries do
not repeat a full sync; the daemon's file watcher handles later source changes.

`--no-sync` skips source refresh and starts any new daemon without automatic
sync. It does not disable sync on an already-running daemon. `--offline` reads
the archive directly, without daemon startup, source sync, or pricing fetches. A
direct online query, when daemon autostart is disabled, retains its incremental
refresh before reading. Read-only mirror daemons do not refresh the local SQLite
archive; stop them to run a local online usage report.

## Scripting Examples

**Monthly spend for the current month:**

Costs are reported as `money` objects, so read `.microdollars` and divide when
you want dollars:

```bash
agentsview usage daily \
  --since "$(date +%Y-%m-01)" \
  --json \
  | jq '.totals.totalCost.microdollars / 1000000'
```

**Per-agent totals for the last 7 days:**

`date` arithmetic differs between BSD (macOS) and GNU (Linux), so the snippet
tries the BSD form first and falls back to GNU:

```bash
since=$(date -v-7d +%Y-%m-%d 2>/dev/null \
  || date -d '7 days ago' +%Y-%m-%d)

for a in claude codex copilot gemini; do
  total=$(agentsview usage daily \
    --since "$since" \
    --agent "$a" \
    --json 2>/dev/null \
    | jq -r '.totals.totalCost.microdollars / 1000000 | tostring')
  printf "%-8s  \$%s\n" "$a" "$total"
done
```

**Alert when today crosses a budget:**

The script writes to stderr and exits non-zero so you can wire it into whatever
notifier fits your OS — cron's `MAILTO`, launchd's `StandardErrorPath`, a
systemd timer's journal, or a Windows Task Scheduler action.

`--json` reports the cost as exact microdollars, so the threshold is an integer
comparison instead of a parse of the formatted line. `jq -e` fails the script
when the value is missing, so a broken read cannot pass for an under-budget day:

```bash
budget_usd=25
spent=$(agentsview usage statusline --json --offline --no-sync \
  | jq -e '.cost.microdollars') || exit 1
if [ "$spent" -gt $((budget_usd * 1000000)) ]; then
  printf 'AgentsView: $%d.%02d today (over $%d)\n' \
    $((spent / 1000000)) $((spent % 1000000 / 10000)) "$budget_usd" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

## Where the Data Lives

Usage reports read from the same local SQLite database that powers the
[web UI](/docs/usage/) and [Analytics dashboard](/docs/usage/#dashboard). Token
usage is stored on each message row in the `messages` table; pricing is cached
in a small `model_pricing` table that's refreshed on each `usage` invocation.

Usage data stays on your machine unless you enable a sharing feature. The usage
command's only outbound requests are the LiteLLM and OpenRouter pricing fetches,
which you can disable with `--offline`. See
[Privacy and Telemetry](/docs/configuration/#privacy-and-telemetry) for the full
picture.

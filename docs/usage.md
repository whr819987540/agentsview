description: Complete guide to the AgentsView web interface
---

AgentsView serves a full-featured web application for browsing, searching, and
analyzing your AI agent sessions. This page walks through every part of the
interface.

## Dashboard

When you open AgentsView with no session selected, you see the analytics
dashboard. It provides a high-level overview of your agent activity across all
projects.

![Analytics dashboard](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/dashboard.png)

The dashboard header includes:

- **Project filter** — typeahead to scope everything to a single project. Type
  to filter by name; each entry shows its session count. Navigate with arrow
  keys, select with Enter, and close with Escape.
- **Search bar** — opens the command palette (`Cmd+K`)
- **Sync button** — triggers a manual sync of session files
- **Theme toggle** — switch between light and dark mode
- **Import button** — opens the [Chat Import](/docs/chat-import/) dialog for
  importing Claude.ai or ChatGPT conversations
- **Shortcuts button** (`?`) — shows all keyboard shortcuts

The status bar at the bottom shows session count, message count, project count,
last sync time, and the build version.

On the normal local `agentsview serve` runtime, the session lists in the sidebar
update automatically from a global SSE event stream (debounced during busy
syncs). The dashboard, Usage page, and Activity page do not refetch their charts
on every sync event — each pairs a manual refresh button with a relative
"Updated…" timestamp, and the Analytics dashboard also refreshes periodically on
its own. Click refresh, or change the date range, to pull the latest numbers.

For range-based concurrency and agent-minutes reporting, use the top-level
[Activity](/docs/activity/) page.

### Summary Cards

Six cards at the top of the dashboard show key metrics for the selected date
range:

![Summary cards](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/summary-cards.png)

| Card             | Description                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Sessions         | Total session count               |
| Messages         | Total message count               |
| Projects         | Number of active projects         |
| Active Days      | Days with at least one session    |
| Messages/Session | Average with median and p90       |
| Concentration    | Most active project and its share |

### Date Range Picker

Quick presets for 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 1 year, and All, plus custom
start/end date inputs. The **All** preset shows every session regardless of age.
All charts update when the range changes. The same range picker is used on the
dashboard, the [Usage](/docs/token-usage/#usage-dashboard) page, and the
[Activity](/docs/activity/) page so presets and behavior stay consistent across
panels.

![Date range picker](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/date-range.png)

Preset ranges are **rolling** by default: a page left open across midnight rolls
the window forward at the next refresh tick, sync event, or manual refresh,
instead of staying anchored to the day it loaded. Manually editing either date
input pins the range. On Usage and Activity, explicit date parameters remain
authoritative. A bare Usage URL returns to its rolling 30-day default; a bare
Activity URL returns to its current-day calendar default unless an enabled
shared range supplies another selection. The `All` preset always pins to
`(earliest_session, today)`.

Bare pages use independent defaults: the Sessions dashboard opens to a rolling
1-year range, Usage opens to a rolling 30-day range, and Activity opens to the
current day. Cross-page linking is disabled by default because applying a broad
range automatically can make some pages run substantially more expensive
queries.

To carry selections among Sessions, Usage, Activity, Trends, and Quality, enable
**Settings > Date ranges > Link date ranges across pages**. An explicit dated
URL always controls the target page. With linking enabled, that selection can
then carry to date-aware pages opened later at their bare URLs.

### Model Filter

The dashboard toolbar includes a **Model** dropdown that scopes every panel to
one or more AI models. By default the button reads **Model: All** and nothing is
filtered.

![Dashboard model filter](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/analytics-model-filter.png)

Open the dropdown for a searchable list of the models found in your sessions,
then click models to include them. The button then shows the chosen model — for
example **Model: gpt-4o** — or **Model: 3 selected** once several are active.
Click the **All models** row at the top of the list to clear the filter and
return to every model. Selected models also appear as removable chips beneath
the toolbar.

While a model filter is active, every dashboard panel reflects only the selected
model(s): the summary cards, activity chart, heatmap, hour-of-week grid,
projects, session shape, velocity, tools, skills, top sessions, and the Session
Health rollup.

Model filtering is **message-grain**, unlike the session-grain project and agent
filters, because a single session can switch models across turns. A session is
included when it has at least one message from a selected model, and most panels
count only the matching messages. The user turn paired with a matching assistant
turn is kept alongside it — even though a user message carries no model of its
own — so prompts and their responses stay aligned in the counts and in the
top-session evidence.

**Session Health** is the exception. It is scoped to whole sessions that used
the selected model, but its health scores, outcomes, tool-failure rates, and
compaction counts stay whole-session aggregates — they are not recomputed from
only that model's messages.

!!! note "Dashboard-only scope"

    The model filter applies only to the analytics dashboard. The
    [Generated insights](/docs/recall/?tab=generated) and the session list are not
    scoped by it, so a model selected here does not silently narrow those views. The
    [Usage](/docs/token-usage/) page keeps its own separate model filter.

### Activity Heatmap

A GitHub-style contribution graph showing daily activity. Toggle between message
count and session count.

![Activity heatmap](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/heatmap.png)

#### Click-to-Filter

Click any heatmap cell to filter all charts and the session list to that single
day. The selected cell gets a highlighted border, and an active filter chip
appears in the toolbar. Click the same cell again (or dismiss the filter chip)
to deselect.

![Heatmap filtered to a single day](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/heatmap-filtered.png)

### Hour of Week Heatmap

A 7x24 grid showing when you use agents most. Rows are days of the week, columns
are hours. Color intensity represents message volume.

![Hour of week heatmap](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/hour-of-week.png)

### Activity Timeline

Compare message or session counts over time. Switch between Day, Week, and
Month to change how the chart groups activity.

![Activity timeline](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/activity-timeline.png)

### Top Sessions

A ranked list of your longest sessions by message count or duration. Click any
session to jump directly to it in the session viewer.

![Top sessions](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/top-sessions.png)

### Project Breakdown

Bar chart of all projects sorted by session or message count. Shows average and
median messages per session for each project. Click any project bar to filter
the dashboard and session list to that project.

![Project breakdown](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/project-breakdown.png)

### Session Shape Distribution

Three histograms showing the distribution of:

1. **Session length** — number of messages per session
1. **Session duration** — time in minutes
1. **Session autonomy** — ratio of tool calls to conversation turns

![Session shape](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/session-shape.png)

### Tool Usage

Total tool call count with breakdowns by category (Read, Edit, Write, Bash,
Search, Web, Task) and by agent. Includes a trend chart showing tool usage over
time.

![Tool usage](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/tool-usage.png)

### Top Skills

The Top Skills panel ranks skill-backed tool calls by call count, session count,
recency, agent mix, and project mix. The adjacent Skill Usage Over Time chart
plots the leading skills, folds the long tail into Other, and lets you switch
between day, week, and month buckets or hide individual series. Both views
follow the active Analytics date and session filters.

Skill analytics is populated from normalized `skill_name` metadata on tool calls
and from inferred skill names when Codex or Cursor reads a `SKILL.md` file
through a read-like tool call. It appears when your local transcripts include
either explicit skill metadata or enough `SKILL.md` reads for AgentsView to
infer the skill name.

![Top Skills](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/top-skills.png)

![Skill usage trends](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/skill-trends.png)

### Velocity Metrics

Performance metrics including:

- Turn cycle time (p50, p90)
- First response time (p50, p90)
- Messages, characters, and tool calls per active minute
- Breakdown by agent and by session complexity

![Velocity metrics](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/velocity.png)

### Agent Comparison

Side-by-side metrics across agents: session count, total messages, average
response time, tool usage patterns, and concentration metrics.

![Agent comparison](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/agent-comparison.png)

### Session Health

The 0.23.0 dashboard adds a **Session Health** section that rolls up the new
session-intelligence signals. It shows:

- average health score and derived grade
- headline counts for the `completed` and `errored` outcomes (`abandoned` and
  `unknown` sessions are not counted here, but are visible in the dashboard's
  outcome-distribution chart alongside them)
- tool-failure rate and sessions with failures
- compaction counts, including mid-task compactions
- score trend over time
- by-agent and by-project score tables

![Session Health section on the dashboard](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/session-health.png)

See [Session Intelligence](/docs/session-intelligence/#outcome-classification)
for the full four-outcome model that both this section and `agentsview stats`
derive from.

### CSV Export

Click **Export CSV** in the dashboard toolbar to download all analytics data as
a CSV file. Includes summary, activity, projects, tools, and velocity sections.

______________________________________________________________________

## Generated Insights

AgentsView can generate model-written reports over an explicit session scope
using Claude, Codex, Copilot, Gemini, or Kiro. Open **Recall → Generated
insights** to choose the date range, project, session agent, automated-session
scope, template, generator, and optional focus.

See [Recall](/docs/recall/#current-surface) for generation, archive, and privacy
details.

______________________________________________________________________

## Trends

Open **More → Trends** in the header navigation for ad-hoc term-frequency line
charts over your session history. Type one term per line into the textarea, hit
**Refresh**, and AgentsView counts how often each term appears in user and
assistant message content over the selected window.

![Trends page](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/trends.png)

Use Trends to track topics or technologies as your work shifts over time — for
example, plotting `rust`, `typescript`, and `python` to see which language
you've been spending the most time in this quarter, or watching whether mentions
of a problem keyword like `flaky` or `timeout` are trending up or down.

The toolbar controls the window and resolution:

- **From / To** — date inputs at the top of the page; defaults cover the last
  year.
- **Granularity** — `day`, `week`, or `month`. Pick coarser buckets for longer
  windows.
- **Normalize by number of messages** — toggle to chart per-term rate instead of
  raw counts, so a busy week doesn't drown out a quiet one.

Each line in the **Terms** textarea is a separate term, capped at 12 terms per
chart. Within a line, pipe-separated variants fold into a single series.
AgentsView also adds a simple plural form (just appending `s`) for each variant,
and for single-word variants ending in `c` it expands the silent-`e` stem
(`slic` matches `slice`, `slices`, `sliced`, `slicing`) — beyond those two
cases, spell out other forms explicitly as pipe variants:

```text
rust
type|types|typing
docker|kubernetes|k8s
```

Matching is case-insensitive. Single-word matchers honor word boundaries — `cat`
won't match `catalog`. Multi-word matchers match as substrings. Each line
accepts up to 8 variants.

The chart panel uses one color per term. Hover a line to highlight that term's
series and draw point markers at each bucket; for exact per-bucket counts,
switch granularities or read off the y-axis. The companion table below the chart
lists each term's color swatch, expanded variants, and total — `Count` in raw
mode or `Per 1k messages` in normalized mode.

Page state lives in the URL — `from`, `to`, `granularity`, `normalized`, and
repeated `term=` parameters — so any view is shareable and bookmarkable.

The same data is available through the `GET /api/v1/trends/terms` endpoint for
scripting, and works under both local `agentsview serve` and shared
[`pg serve`](/docs/pg-sync/) deployments.

## Session Browser

The left sidebar lists all sessions with virtual scrolling for smooth
performance even with thousands of sessions. On desktop, drag the resize handle
between the sidebar and the content pane to adjust the sidebar width. The width
is constrained between 220px and 520px, always leaving at least 480px for the
content area. Your preferred width is saved in localStorage and restored on next
visit.

As of 0.30.0, the sidebar loads from a skinny session-index endpoint and
hydrates the visible rows on demand, so large refresh storms (e.g. after a bulk
import or `resync`) no longer freeze the list while the full payloads arrive.

![Session list](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/session-list.png)

Each session item shows:

- **Status indicator** — small dot on the left whose color and animation reflect
  both how recently the session was active and whether it ended cleanly. See
  [Session status indicator](#session-status-indicator) for the full state
  set.
- **Session name** — display name if set, otherwise first message text. OpenCode
  sessions use their native session titles. As of 0.27.0, Copilot CLI sessions
  use the `name` field from the session's `workspace.yaml` when present,
  falling back to the first user message otherwise. As of 0.33.0, labels are
  no longer hard-truncated at 50 characters — the full label is clipped
  responsively to the sidebar width instead.
- **Agent-provided session names** — several agents record a session title
  themselves (Claude Code's `/rename`, Codex `session_index.jsonl` thread
  names, Claude.ai and ChatGPT conversation names, Forge, Hermes, Kiro,
  Piebald, Cortex Code, WorkBuddy, and Command Code's `.meta.json` titles). The
  sidebar shows these titles automatically when present. Manual in-app
  renames always take precedence and are never overwritten by an
  agent-provided name. As of 0.34.0, Codex titles renamed by the agent are
  imported from `session_index.jsonl` for both current and archived sessions.
- **Model name** — the AI model used for the session, shown when available
  (including Codex session models).
- **Star button** — click the star icon or press `s` to star a session. Starred
  sessions persist in the SQLite database so they survive server restarts.
- **Agent tag** — agent name on the right side, tinted with the agent's accent
  color.
- **Machine label** — when using [PostgreSQL sync](/docs/pg-sync/), sessions
  from other machines show a machine name tag. Only visible in shared
  multi-host deployments.
- **Project name** — abbreviated, right-aligned
- **Relative time** — "2h ago", "Mon", "Dec 1"
- **User prompt count** — number of user messages in the session

When a session has a native resume target, the sidebar also exposes a direct
native session link so supported agents can reopen their own session instead of
only navigating inside AgentsView.

### Session Status Indicator

As of 0.27.0, the small dot at the left edge of each session row encodes how
recently the session was written to and how it last ended. The same indicator
appears in the dashboard's **Top Sessions** list. Hover the dot for a tooltip
explaining the current state.

| State   | Indicator         | Meaning                                                                                                                 |
| ------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Working | Pulsing green     | Last write within the last minute                                                                                       |
| Waiting | Tan speech bubble | Session ended on the agent's "your turn" stop reason and was active in the last 10 minutes                              |
| Idle    | Muted green       | 1–10 minutes idle, not awaiting user input                                                                              |
| Stale   | Amber             | 10–60 minutes idle and last assistant message has an unresolved tool call (or the session file was truncated mid-write) |
| Unclean | Red               | Same flagged state as Stale, but idle for more than an hour                                                             |
| Quiet   | Hidden            | Cleanly-ended sessions older than 10 minutes; no dot is rendered                                                        |

The "flagged" tier (Stale and Unclean) is meant to surface sessions that look
like an agent crashed mid tool call or had its session file truncated, so
they're easy to pick out from sessions that simply haven't been touched in a
while.

Termination classification currently runs for **Claude Code** and **Codex**
sessions — those parsers read the per-message `stop_reason` (Claude) or task
lifecycle events (Codex). Other agents render as plain time-based states
(Working / Idle / Quiet) without the flagged tier.

When a parent session has subagents or a continuation chain, the dot reflects
the freshest activity across the group: a parent in `tool_call_pending` whose
subagent is currently writing rolls up to Working green. The parent's parser
status still wins for the Waiting state — a fork running in parallel doesn't
change that the parent has said *"your turn"*.

### Group by Agent

Click the group-by-agent toggle in the sidebar header to organize sessions into
collapsible sections by agent type. Each agent group shows a color-coded dot,
agent name, and session count. Click an agent header to expand or collapse its
section. Groups start collapsed when first enabled.

### Sub-Agent Tree

When a session spawns sub-agents or teams, the sidebar organizes them in a
collapsible tree view. Parent sessions show a disclosure triangle; click to
expand and see child agents nested underneath. This makes complex multi-agent
workflows easier to navigate without leaving the session list.

![Sub-agent tree view](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/subagent-tree.png)

### Forks and Subagent Sessions

AgentsView automatically detects conversation forks in Claude Code sessions —
for example, when you use "retry from here" to branch a conversation. Large
forks (more than 3 user turns) appear as separate session entries grouped with
their parent. Small retries fold into the main session.

Subagent sessions spawned by the Task tool are organized under their parent in
the sidebar's [sub-agent tree](#sub-agent-tree) and are also viewable inline
through the parent session's tool blocks (see
[Subagent Linking](#subagent-linking) below). Claude companion session layouts
are also linked when the parent can be inferred from the companion directory
structure, including externalized tool result content stored beside the
transcript.

### Session Filters

Click the filter icon next to the session count to open a dropdown with several
filter categories that can be combined:

![Session filter dropdown](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/session-filters.png)

- **Starred** — toggle to show only starred sessions
- **Recently Active** — toggle to show only sessions updated within the last 24
  hours
- **Agent** — searchable multi-select of
  [supported agents](/docs/configuration/#session-discovery). Click an agent
  to toggle its selection; multiple agents can be active at once.
- **Machine** — searchable multi-select of machine names. Surfaces in shared
  [PostgreSQL sync](/docs/pg-sync/) deployments when more than five machines
  have pushed sessions.
- **Status** — three-pill multi-select of the
  [status](#session-status-indicator) recency tiers (**Active**, **Stale**,
  **Unclean**), tinted to match the indicator colors. The underlying
  `?termination=` URL parameter and API also accept the parser-side values
  `clean` and `awaiting_user`, but those aren't exposed as sidebar pills.
- **Min Prompts** — filter to sessions with at least 2, 3, 5, or 10 user
  messages
- **Include single-turn** — toggle to include sessions with one or fewer user
  messages (excluded by default to reduce noise)
- **Include automated** — toggle to include sessions classified as automation
  (roborev runs, title generation, AgentsView's own internal prompts, and any
  patterns you've added to
  [`[automated] prefixes`](/docs/configuration/#automated-session-detection))
- **Hide unknown** — toggle to hide sessions whose project could not be
  determined

When any filter is active, a green dot appears on the filter button. Click
**Clear filters** at the bottom of the dropdown to reset all filters at once.

As of 0.27.0, the sidebar filter store is shared with the analytics dashboard
and the Usage page: agent, machine, project, min user-message threshold,
hide-single-turn, and include-automated selections applied in the sidebar carry
across to the dashboard panels and the Usage page header, which mounts the same
filter widget. The **Status** filter is sidebar- and dashboard-only — the Usage
page does not currently filter by termination status. Filter state is also
persisted to localStorage and serialized into the URL.

### Direct Session Links

Click **Copy link to session** in the detail header to copy a shareable URL.
Clicking the **Session ID** copies only the ID. Session links give the provider
and native ID separate path segments, for example:

```
/sessions/codex/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

Older links with an encoded provider prefix still open. IDs without a provider
prefix use a single segment after `/sessions/`.

Session URLs work as bookmarks and can be shared with teammates when using
[PostgreSQL sync](/docs/pg-sync/) for shared deployments.

### Open a session by ID

Press `Cmd+G` on macOS or `Ctrl+G` elsewhere. Paste a complete session ID or
UUID, then press Enter. This opens the session without changing the sidebar
filters. If the UUID matches more than one session, use its full ID with the
provider prefix, such as `codex:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`.

![Open a session by ID or UUID](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/open-session.png)

### URL Filters

URL parameters are supported for direct linking:

```
/sessions?project=myapp&agent=claude&date_from=2025-01-01
```

Available URL filters:

| Parameter                      | Value                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project`                      | comma-separated project names                                                                                             |

| `machine`                      | comma-separated machine names                                                                                             |
| `termination`                  | comma-separated [status](#session-status-indicator) tiers — any of `active`, `stale`, `unclean`, `clean`, `awaiting_user` |
| `date`, `date_from`, `date_to` | ISO date or activity-overlap range bounds                                                                                 |
| `active_since`                 | `true` to limit to the last 24 hours                                                                                      |
| `min_messages`, `max_messages` | numeric message count bounds                                                                                              |
| `min_user_messages`            | numeric user-message threshold                                                                                            |
| `include_one_shot`             | `false` to hide single-turn sessions (default)                                                                            |
| `include_automated`            | `true` to include automated sessions                                                                                      |
| `exclude_project`              | comma-separated projects to hide (e.g. `unknown`)                                                                         |

### Navigation

Use `]` and `[` to move between sessions in the list. The selected session is
highlighted with a left border accent.

______________________________________________________________________

## Message Viewer

Selecting a session opens the message viewer in the main content area. Messages
display in a scrollable list with virtual rendering for large sessions.

![Message viewer](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/message-viewer.png)

The session detail header shows the session name, agent, project, a health grade
badge, and a copyable **Session ID**. Click the ID to copy it to the clipboard
for sharing or lookup. Click the grade badge to toggle the signal panel.

The model badge shows the model used most often in assistant messages. For
Claude Code and Codex, it also shows recorded reasoning effort, such as `high`,
when that value is the most common effort for the displayed model. Effort is a
model setting, not a measured token count. Upgrading resyncs existing sessions
to populate it when the source files remain available.

If a parser skipped malformed source lines while still recovering the session,
the header shows a malformed-lines badge with the persisted count (for example
"3 malformed lines"). For Antigravity IDE and CLI sessions decoded from an
unrecognized SQLite schema fingerprint, the header also shows **Unverified
schema**. That badge means the session was decoded heuristically from a newer
schema and may be incomplete.

AgentsView stores reading progress for the most recent 500 sessions in the
current browser. When a transcript changes after you have read it, the sidebar
shows an unread dot and the transcript places a **New messages** boundary at the
first unread region. In newest-first order the same boundary is labeled
**Earlier messages**. The marker clears after you traverse the new region; it is
browser-local and is not synced through SQLite or PostgreSQL.

### Message Layouts

Four layouts control how messages are rendered. Cycle between them with the `l`
key or the layout button in the header, or pick one directly in Settings >
Appearance:

| Layout  | Description                                               |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default | Full card layout with colored borders and spacing         |
| Compact | Condensed view with minimal spacing                       |
| Stream  | Continuous flow optimized for reading                     |
| Skim    | Collapses tool calls to summary headers for fast skimming |

### Focused Transcript Mode

Focused mode strips intermediate tool calls, thinking blocks, and partial
assistant messages, showing only user prompts and final assistant responses.
This makes long sessions easier to read as a clean conversation transcript.
Task notifications and stop hook feedback count as part of the turn they
interrupt rather than as new prompts, so a session that waits on background
agents still collapses to its prompts and final answers.

![Focused transcript mode](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/focused-transcript.png)

Toggle between Normal and Focused mode using the transcript mode button in the
session header. The header adjusts responsively to fit the available space. The
mode preference is saved in localStorage.

### Message Display

Each message has a colored left border indicating role:

- **Blue** — user messages
- **Purple** — assistant messages

The header shows the role label, timestamp, and a **copy button** that appears
on hover. Click it to copy the full message content to the clipboard — a
checkmark confirms the copy for 1.5 seconds.

Inline `<teammate-message>` content and messages from teammate session ancestry
are labeled **Teammate**, keeping peer-agent replies distinct from user prompts
and ordinary subagent output.

Claude Code sessions also show a fork action on each message header when the
local server can launch or return a command. Clicking it starts a new Claude run
from the selected point by rendering the transcript through that message ordinal
into a temporary prompt, starting `claude` in the session working directory, and
removing the temporary prompt after launch. In read-only local mode the action
copies the command instead of launching it; remote sessions cannot be forked
from the browser.

### Thinking Blocks

Assistant thinking blocks appear as collapsible sections with a purple left
border. Toggle visibility for thinking blocks using the
[block-type filter](#block-type-filtering) in the header.

### Tool Blocks

Tool invocations display as collapsible amber-bordered sections showing the tool
name, arguments, and output. When collapsed, the header surfaces the most
meaningful input field rather than the first line of the rendered content.
`TodoWrite` shows the in-progress (or last) todo with a `→` prefix; `TaskCreate`
shows the subject; `TaskUpdate` shows `#<id> · <status> · <subject>`; `Skill`
shows the skill name; `ToolSearch` shows the first line of the query; and
`Task`/`Agent`/subagent calls show the description (falling back to the prompt).
For tools without a structured preview, the header falls back to the first line
of content, the `command`/`cmd` (Bash), or the `file_path`/`pattern` (Read,
Edit, Write, Glob).

![Tool blocks](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/tool-blocks.png)

When expanded, tool blocks display structured metadata tags extracted from the
tool call input. For task management tools (TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskGet),
these tags show the task subject, status, and ID at a glance. Bash tool blocks
show the full command text, including multi-line commands like heredocs that
would otherwise be truncated. Tool result content is stored alongside the tool
call when available, giving a complete view of input and output.

Expanded outputs start in **Raw** mode, which preserves the exact escaped text
recorded by the agent. Switch to **Formatted** to render Markdown, including
headings, lists, tables, and highlighted fenced code; HTML is sanitized before
display. The mode changes presentation only—the stored result and copy button
continue to use the raw output.

![Formatted tool output](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/tool-output-formatted.png)

Hover or focus a tool block to reveal copy buttons for the structured input and,
when present, the tool output.

![Copy buttons on a tool block](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/tool-block-copy-btn.png)

Codex tool calls receive special formatting: bash commands, write_stdin
operations, and apply_patch calls display with structured argument previews and
categorized detail labels. Cursor `ApplyPatch` tool calls render as patch/diff
content instead of plain JSON when the Cursor transcript exposes the patch
payload.

When a Codex tool call has subagent result events — status updates captured
during execution — an expandable **history** section appears below the tool
output. Click it to see the full chronological timeline of status changes (e.g.
"wait", "completed", "failed") with source and content for each event. The
latest event summary is shown by default.

### Subagent Linking

When a Task or Agent tool block is linked to a subagent session, it shows an
expandable toggle. Click it to view the subagent's full transcript inline
without leaving the parent session. Messages load on demand when the section is
expanded, showing the complete subagent conversation with role labels and
timestamps.

### Tool Call Groups

Consecutive tool-only assistant messages are grouped into compact "N tool calls"
sections with a gear icon and timestamp. Click to expand individual tool blocks
within the group.

![Tool call groups](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/tool-groups.png)

### Code Blocks

Fenced code blocks render with language labels, monospace formatting, and
horizontal scrolling for long lines. Hover or focus a code block to reveal a
**copy button** in the corner; clicking it copies the raw code (no fences or
language tag) to the clipboard.

As of 0.33.0, labeled code fences get **syntax highlighting** powered by Shiki.
Twelve common languages are bundled — JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Bash,
JSON, YAML, Markdown, HTML, CSS, Rust, Go, and SQL (plus their usual aliases
like `py`, `sh`, and `yml`). Unlabeled or unrecognized languages fall back to
plain text. To keep large sessions fast, highlighting is skipped for blocks over
50 KB or 800 lines, and the highlighter loads lazily so it costs nothing until
the first code fence renders.

Fenced code blocks labeled `mermaid` render as Mermaid diagrams in an
interactive viewer with source-copy and expanded-view controls. If the Mermaid
runtime cannot load, AgentsView keeps the escaped diagram source readable in the
message. When in-session search is active, Mermaid fences render as source code
so matches can be highlighted.

![Copy button on a code block](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/code-block-copy-btn.png)

### Block-Type Filtering

Click the filter icon in the message viewer header to open a dropdown that
toggles visibility of six content categories:

| Category  | What It Controls          |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| User      | User messages             |
| Assistant | Assistant responses       |
| Thinking  | Thinking/reasoning blocks |
| Tool      | Tool call blocks          |
| Code      | Code blocks               |
| System    | System boundary cards     |

Turning off **Code** collapses each fenced block into an inline placeholder
showing its language and an **Expand** button. Expand or collapse individual
blocks without changing the global filter. Messages containing only code keep
their placeholder. Filtered code stays out of in-session search; turn **Code**
back on to include it.

System boundary cards are the compact rows that mark a session continuation or
resume, an interrupted request, a task notification, or stop hook feedback.
Hiding the category removes all of them; the rest of the transcript is
unaffected.

All categories are visible by default. When any are hidden, a badge on the
filter button shows the count of hidden types. Click **Show all** to restore
visibility.

### Sorting

Toggle between newest-first and oldest-first with the `o` key or the sort button
in the header. The arrow icon indicates the current direction.

### Message Navigation

- `j` or `↓` — next message
- `k` or `↑` — previous message
- `Shift+J` — next user prompt
- `Shift+K` — previous user prompt
- Click a message to select it (blue outline)

Prompt navigation follows the visible transcript, so it respects Focused mode
and the active block-type filter.

### In-Session Search

Press `Cmd+F` (or `Ctrl+F`) to open a search bar within the current session.
Type to find matching text across all visible messages. The match count and
current position are shown in the search bar.

![In-session search](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/in-session-search.png)

Use the arrow buttons or `Enter` / `Shift+Enter` to jump between matches. The
matching message scrolls into view and the search term is highlighted. Press
`Esc` to close the search bar.

Click **Show search results** to open matching snippets grouped by message.
Select a snippet to jump to its occurrence. The overview rail beside the
transcript shows where matches appear throughout the session.

![In-session search results and overview rail](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/in-session-search-results.png)

Search follows the transcript's active scope. Block-type filters (see
[Block-Type Filtering](#block-type-filtering)) and Focused mode both narrow what
search can find: a hidden category contributes no matches, counts, badges, or
highlights, and re-showing a category or returning to Normal mode makes that
content searchable again without retyping the query. Folded content is still
searched — collapsed tool output, thinking blocks, `<details>` sections, and
rows that are not currently scrolled into view all match; only the current
occurrence expands and scrolls into view. The match count, result list, and
overview rail read the same filtered index, so they update immediately when a
filter toggles during an active query.

### Token Usage

The session detail header displays token usage when available, showing input and
output token counts for the session. This gives a quick view of how much context
the agent consumed and how much it generated.

![Token usage display](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/token-usage.png)

As of 0.33.0, the header also shows the session's **estimated cost** next to the
token summary, computed from the same data as
[`agentsview session usage`](/docs/session-api/#agentsview-session-usage). Costs
under a cent display as `<$0.01`, costs up to $100 with two decimals, and larger
costs as whole dollars. The badge is hidden when the session has no token data
or its models have no pricing.

When the selected session has explicit `subagent` descendants, the automatic
header request adds `rollup=true`. A complete priced aggregate shows a localized
total marker and the descendant count. If any contributing row is unpriced, the
header keeps the root session's own cost when available and does not label it as
a total. Sessions without explicit subagent descendants keep the existing badge.

As of 0.37.1, sessions with per-step usage rows also show a **step count** next
to the token summary. Click it to expand a per-step breakdown: each row lists
the prompt or usage event, the model that served it, its context size (input
tokens plus cache reads and writes), its output tokens, and a per-step cost
estimate when the model is priced. The rows come from the same session usage API
with `?breakdown=true` — see
[`agentsview session usage`](/docs/session-api/#agentsview-session-usage).

For aggregate token usage and estimated cost reports across all sessions, see
the [Token Usage & Costs](/docs/token-usage/) page and the
[`agentsview usage daily`](/docs/commands/#agentsview-usage-daily) CLI command.

For a scriptable report on the current session, use
[`agentsview session usage <id>`](/docs/session-api/#agentsview-session-usage)
or the matching
[`GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/usage`](/docs/session-api/#agentsview-session-usage)
REST endpoint.

### Signal Panel

Click the health grade badge in the session header to open the signal panel for
the current session. The panel shows:

- grade and numeric score
- outcome icon and confidence
- basis tags showing whether outcome, tool health, and context pressure
  contributed to the score
- compaction summary, including mid-task compactions
- penalty chips for the deductions that were applied

When a session does not have enough usable data, the panel shows a small empty
state instead of a score. See
[Session Intelligence](/docs/session-intelligence/) for the full model.

### Session Vital Signs

Open **Analysis** from the session header to see Session Vitals in the right
column. It shows elapsed turn time and measured tool durations.

![Session Vital Signs in context](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/session-vital-signs.png)

The panel contains these sections, including experimental Recall when available:

- **Session summary** — repository and worktree context recorded by the trace,
    total wall-clock, turn count, tool call count, sub-agent count, and the
    slowest call as a clickable link that scrolls the conversation to that call.
    Live sessions show a `running …+` indicator that ticks forward.
- **Recall (experimental)** — provenance-linked entries whose evidence comes
    from the current session. Evidence-range links jump to the supporting
    transcript message. An empty state appears when the local archive has no
    matching entries.
- **Turn activity** — each visible user prompt starts a window that ends at the
    next prompt or the session boundary. Bars separate measured tool execution
    from unattributed time, which has no measured phase boundaries. Thinking
    and response generation are not measured. Click a row to jump to its prompt
    in the transcript.
- **Time spent** — per-category aggregate bars across the normalized taxonomy
    (`Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Task`, `Tool`, `Other`,
    and other provider categories). Click a row to filter the rest of the panel
    to that category.
- **Timeline** — turns lane plus per-category lanes plus an activity lane, with
    a legend. Hover a turn segment to see its primary category and duration
    (e.g. `Task · 2m`); click to scroll the conversation to that turn.
- **Calls** — chronological list of tool calls with horizontal duration bars.
    Parallel `tool_use` runs are bracketed as a single group. Call details start
    collapsed for quicker transcript navigation. Sub-agent rows expand inline to
    show the child session's calls.

![Vital Signs panel detail](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/vital-signs-panel.png)

Tool durations come from paired execution events or a closed linked child
session. A call without either source shows `unknown`; the summary and category
totals show **Not measured** when no calls have measured durations. A measured
zero remains `0ms`. Categories remain available as filters even without timing.
An open child needs a completed execution interval before its call can show a
duration; otherwise it stays unknown until the child closes.

Session tool and category totals count only time within the session boundaries.
Individual calls retain their full measured durations, including any time
outside the parent session. Overlapping calls count once in the session total
and once per category, so category totals can overlap each other.

Inline in the conversation column, tool headers show measured durations when
available, and assistant messages show turn-summary lines. Tool labels are
normalized across agents, so Codex's `exec_command` and Claude's `Bash` show up
under the same "Bash" category in headers and in the Calls list.

Call duration bars in the Calls list are scaled relative to the longest call in
scope, not total session wall-clock — so even in long sessions where any single
call is a small fraction of the total, call-vs-call comparison stays legible.
Very short calls floor at 4% width to remain visible.

### Progressive Loading

Sessions with more than 3,000 messages load the most recent 1,000 messages
first. Older pages load automatically as you scroll up. Smaller sessions load
all messages at once.

### Live Updates

When viewing an active session, AgentsView uses Server-Sent Events to stream new
messages in real time. The message list updates incrementally — only new
activity is fetched, rather than reloading the entire session — so updates
arrive faster and with less overhead.

### Follow Latest Message

As of 0.30.0, the session header has a **Follow latest messages** toggle. When
active, the message list auto-scrolls to the newest message as updates stream
in, so a long-running session stays pinned to the tail without manual scrolling.
The toggle is also handy after a sync that rebuilt the session — it snaps back
to the latest message once the re-rendered list settles.

![Follow latest toggle in the session header](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/follow-latest-toggle.png)

Cancellation is automatic: scrolling up by hand or clicking a specific message
turns follow mode off. Clicking the toggle again re-engages it and jumps to the
latest message. The preference is persisted in localStorage, so a session you
opened in follow mode comes back in follow mode.

______________________________________________________________________

## Command Palette

Press `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K`) to open the command palette — a full-screen search
overlay.

![Command palette](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/command-palette.png)

### Recent Sessions

With an empty query, the palette shows up to 10 recent sessions from the
sidebar's current list. A short query filters that list by project, session
name, or first message. Search begins at 3 characters, or 2 characters for
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text.

### Search Modes

Search in one of three modes:

- **Full text** searches indexed message content with FTS5. It also matches
  session display names and first messages.
- **Semantic** ranks message content by meaning using the active embeddings
  index.
- **Hybrid** combines semantic and full-text rankings so that both conceptual
  and exact-term matches can surface.

The palette remembers the last mode you selected across openings and browser
sessions. Results update after a 300ms typing pause.

!!! tip

    For deeper searches across full transcripts — including tool inputs, tool result
    content, and regex patterns — use the
    [`agentsview session search`](/docs/session-api/#agentsview-session-search) CLI
    or the `GET /api/v1/search/content` HTTP endpoint added in 0.30.0. The command
    palette indexes message bodies via FTS5 for fast scoring; the content-search
    endpoints add substring and regex modes and cover tool I/O as well.

![Search results](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/search-results.png)

Results are grouped by session — each session shows its best matching result.
This prevents a single long session from dominating the results list. Full text
also matches against session display names and first messages, so you can find
sessions by title.

In Full text mode, use the sort toggle in the palette header to switch between
**Relevance** (best matches first) and **Recency** (newest sessions first).
Semantic and Hybrid use their backend rankings, so this toggle is hidden in
those modes.

Semantic and Hybrid require an enabled
[`[vector]`](semantic-search.md#enabling-vector) configuration and an active
embeddings index. If setup, index state, or the embeddings service prevents a
search, the palette keeps the selected mode and shows actionable remediation
rather than silently falling back to Full text.

Results use a compact row:

- **Full text** may show the session name and a sanitized snippet with
  highlighted search terms.
- **Semantic and Hybrid** lead with a plain-text matching snippet. Content
  search does not return a session name or highlight markup.
- **All modes** show an agent-colored dot, project and result time, and a
  copyable session ID.

Select a result to jump to that session and scroll directly to the matching
message.

### Project and date filters

Once your query is long enough to search, the palette shows project and date
controls. Search starts with the sidebar's selected project; choose another
project or **All Projects** without changing the sidebar.

Choose a relative period, calendar period, or custom dates. The filters apply
to Full text, Semantic, and Hybrid searches. Closing the palette clears its date
range; the next opening starts with the sidebar's current project again.

![Command palette with project and date filters](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/search-filters.png)

### Keyboard Navigation

- `↑` / `↓` — navigate results
- `Enter` — select current result
- `Esc` — close palette

______________________________________________________________________

## Session Management

### Renaming Sessions

Double-click a session name in the sidebar to rename it inline. You can also
right-click a session to open a context menu and select **Rename**. Press Enter
to save or Escape to cancel. The custom name persists as a `display_name` in the
database and overrides the default first-message title.

### Trash

Press `Del` (or `Backspace`) with a session selected, or right-click and select
**Delete**, to move it to the trash. An undo toast appears briefly to let you
recover the session immediately. Trashed sessions are hidden from all listings
and analytics.

Click **More → Trash** in the header navigation to view trashed sessions. From
the trash page you can restore individual sessions or permanently delete them.
Use **Empty trash** to permanently delete all trashed sessions at once.

### Batch Selection

Click the **Multi-select** toggle in the sidebar header to enter selection mode.
A checkbox appears on each session; click sessions to check them, or use **All**
to select every visible session and **Clear** to deselect. The batch toolbar
shows how many are selected and a **Delete** action that moves the whole
selection to the trash at once. Toggle multi-select off to return to normal
browsing.

### Pinned Messages

Click the pin icon on any message header to pin it. Pinned messages are saved to
the database and accessible from **More → Pinned** in the header navigation.

The pinned page shows a gallery-style grid of pinned messages. Each card shows
the message content (expandable for long messages), the session and project it
belongs to, and actions to copy the content, unpin, or navigate back to the
source message in its session.

### Session Resume Menu

Select a session and open **Resume** in the detail header. For supported local
agents, the menu can launch the configured terminal, use the default terminal,
or copy the exact resume command. Cursor resume resolves the original workspace
path and passes it as `--workspace` to `cursor agent --resume`. The same menu
can copy the session directory and open it in detected editors or file browsers.

Pi sessions use `pi --session` with the transcript path when available, or the
native session ID. For Pi, **Copy command** includes the working directory so
you can paste the complete command into a shell. Augure Code sessions use
`augure resume`. Copying a session's directory path also works when that
directory has been deleted.

Local Codex sessions add **Open in Codex Desktop**, which deep-links to the
stored thread. Local Claude sessions add **Open in Claude Code**, which opens a
new Code session for the stored working directory; when the native Claude
Desktop opener is detected, it remains available as a separate resume target.

![Session resume menu](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/session-resume-menu.png)

For supported remote sessions, choose **Copy command** and paste the resume
command into a shell on the machine that owns the transcript. Launching a
terminal, opening an editor, and native agent desktop links are local-session
actions.

![Copy command in a remote session's Resume menu](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/remote-resume-command.png)

The `agentsview session list --resume` and `--active` CLI modes use the same
recent-activity signal to produce a compact terminal table for picking up
in-flight work.

These actions let you quickly pick up where you left off without manually
navigating to the project directory.

### The agentsview:// URL Scheme

The desktop app registers the `agentsview://` URL scheme, so other tools can
open a session directly in the app:

```bash
open "agentsview://sessions/<session-id>"
```

An optional `?msg=<ordinal>` or `?msg=last` query scrolls to that message. If the
app is already running, its window comes forward on the session; if not, the app
starts and opens the session once the backend is ready. See the
[Session API](/docs/session-api/) guide for the full contract.

______________________________________________________________________

## Session Export

Press `e` or open the export menu in the header to download the current session
as a standalone HTML file. The exported file includes styled message rendering
and works offline. The export includes a **Normal / Focused** radio toggle in
the document header so the recipient can flip into
[focused mode](#focused-transcript-mode) — only user prompts and final assistant
responses — without re-running the export.

The same menu also includes **Copy markdown export link**, which copies a URL
for the session's markdown export endpoint. That link can be used in scripts,
notes, or shared internal tooling when you want a text-oriented representation
instead of the standalone HTML export. When the active session has a source file
path, the menu also offers **Copy source file path** for quick handoff to
another tool or terminal. The markdown export is particularly well-suited for
handing session context to another agent.

The markdown export route is:

```text
GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/md
```

By default, it exports only the current session. Add the `depth` query parameter
to inline descendants:

- `?depth=1` — include direct child sessions
- `?depth=all` — include the full descendant tree

Subagent children are embedded inline near the tool call that spawned them.
Other child sessions are appended after the parent transcript in
`<child_session>` blocks. The markdown payload also includes XML-style tags for
metadata, thinking blocks, tool calls, code blocks, and child-session
boundaries.

Typical agent handoff flow:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/sessions/<session-id>/md?depth=all" \
  -o session-context.md
```

Then attach `session-context.md` to another agent run or paste its contents into
a prompt so the next agent can inspect the full session tree without opening the
AgentsView UI.

______________________________________________________________________

## Publish to Gist

Press `p` or click the publish button to share a session via GitHub Gist. As of
0.33.0, the publish button is a dropdown with two entries: **Publish public
Gist** and **Publish secret Gist**. The `p` shortcut publishes publicly.

![Publish modal](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/publish-modal.png)

AgentsView prefers your existing GitHub CLI login for local publishing. If no
token is saved in AgentsView and `AGENTSVIEW_GITHUB_TOKEN` is not set, it runs
`gh auth token` and uses that token to create the gist. Run `gh auth login` once
if the GitHub CLI is not authenticated yet.

For remote or proxied AgentsView access, save a GitHub token in AgentsView
before publishing. Remote requests do not use the server process environment or
GitHub CLI credential as a fallback.

If neither a saved token, `AGENTSVIEW_GITHUB_TOKEN`, nor `gh auth token` is
available for local publishing, the publish modal prompts for a GitHub personal
access token with the `gist` scope. That token is saved to your config file and
reused for future publishes.

!!! warning

    Secret gists are unlisted, not access-controlled: they don't appear in your
    public gist list or in search, but anyone who has the URL can read them.

After publishing, the modal shows two URLs:

- **View URL** — rendered view of the gist
- **Gist URL** — direct GitHub link

Both have copy buttons and an "Open in Browser" action.

______________________________________________________________________

## Session Upload

Upload session JSONL files from other machines via the API:

```bash
curl -F "file=@session.jsonl" \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/sessions/upload?project=myapp"
```

Uploaded files are stored in `~/.agentsview/uploads/` and synced into the
database.

Replacing an existing session with fewer messages returns `409 Conflict` without
changing the stored transcript. To permit an intentional shorter rewrite, add
`allow_shorter=true` to the upload query.

## Settings

Click the gear icon in the header to open the Settings page. Settings are
organized into sections:

![Settings page](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/settings.png)

| Section            | What You Can Configure                                                                                   |

| Terminal           | Default terminal emulator for session resume                                                             |
| Embeddings         | Current semantic-index build phase, progress, throughput, ETA, last result, and local generations        |
| GitHub             | Personal access token for Gist publishing                                                                |
| Remote Access      | Remote connections toggle, auth token, connect to remote server                                          |

Spanish is available in builds from `main` after version 0.44.0.

![Chart color palette setting](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/settings-chart-colors.png)

Language, theme, high contrast, message layout, zoom, block visibility, and
Date ranges preferences use local storage in the current browser or desktop
webview profile. Each profile keeps its own choices. The optional `zoom_level`
setting supplies a default when no local zoom or text-size preference exists.

Chart colors use the server-wide `chart_palette` setting in
`~/.agentsview/config.toml`. Agent directory overrides, terminal settings, the
saved GitHub token, and the local server's remote-access authentication
settings also use that file. Worktree mapping rules moved to the
[Data page](/docs/data/#rules) and live in the local archive database. See
[Remote Access](/docs/remote-access/) for details on the remote access settings.

## About Dialog

Click the version number in the status bar or select **About** from the header
menu to open the About dialog. It shows the current version, build date, git
commit, and links to the changelog and GitHub repository.

## Zoom

Settings > Appearance has one Zoom setting for the whole interface in both the
browser and desktop app. It offers 67%, 75%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 110%, 120%, 125%,
130%, 150%, 175%, and 200%. Existing text-size preferences migrate to Zoom. A
saved non-default zoom takes precedence. Otherwise, a saved non-default text
size takes precedence over 100%.

To set the default for clients without a local preference, edit
`~/.agentsview/config.toml` and add `zoom_level = 120`. The field accepts the
twelve values listed above. Restart the daemon and reload the client after a
manual edit. Zoom changes in the interface stay local to that browser or
desktop webview and do not write `config.toml`.

The desktop status bar and shortcuts change the same local setting. Use
`Cmd+Plus` and `Cmd+Minus`, or `Ctrl+Plus` and `Ctrl+Minus` on Windows, to zoom
in and out. `Cmd+0`, or `Ctrl+0` on Windows, resets Zoom to 100%.

## Theme

Click the theme toggle in the header or go to Settings > Appearance to switch
between light and dark mode. The preference is saved and persists across
sessions.

![Light theme](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/theme-light.png)

![Dark theme](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/theme-dark.png)

Settings > Appearance also offers a **high-contrast** mode for greater
legibility. The theme and high-contrast preferences persist across sessions.

The **Chart colors** control selects the categorical palette used by the
dashboard skill trend, Trends, and Usage charts. Choose **Agentsview** for the
project palette or **Matplotlib** for its gray-free categorical families. This
setting is server-wide rather than browser-local, so all clients connected to
the same writable server use the same palette.

### Iframe Embedding

When embedding AgentsView in an iframe, the parent page can control the theme
via `postMessage`:

```javascript
iframe.contentWindow.postMessage(
  { type: "theme:set", theme: "dark" },
  "*"
);
```

Accepted values for `theme` are `"light"` and `"dark"`.

## Sync

AgentsView automatically syncs session files on startup and watches for changes
in real time. The sync status is shown in the status bar:

- **Syncing indicator** — green text showing progress percentage and phase
  (`Scanning [project]...` or parse progress)
- **Last sync time** — relative timestamp ("synced 2h ago") that updates
  automatically. Hover to see the exact sync timestamp.

Press `r` to trigger a manual sync. The sync button in the header shows a
spinning animation while syncing.

The status bar also shows a version mismatch warning (red) if the frontend and
backend versions differ. Click it to reload.

### Full Resync

![Resync modal](/docs/assets/generated/screenshots/resync-modal.png)

Click the **gear icon** in the header to open the Full Resync modal. This
re-parses all session files from scratch using a non-destructive flow — existing
session data is preserved and orphaned sessions (those no longer present on
disk) are carried forward. This is useful after upgrading AgentsView or when
sessions appear to be parsed incorrectly.

The modal shows live progress as sessions are processed:

1. **Confirm** — describes what the resync does, with Start and Cancel buttons
1. **Progress** — live counter and progress bar ("Syncing X / Y sessions...").
   The modal stays open until the resync finishes.
1. **Done** — shows synced, skipped, and total session counts
1. **Error** — if the resync fails, shows the error with Retry and Close buttons

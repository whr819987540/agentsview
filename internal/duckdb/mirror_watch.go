// SameMirrorFile reports whether two Stat results describe the same

// path was already rename-replaced before that first call, the "old"
// FileInfo resolves the NEW file's identity and os.SameFile reports the
// two as equal forever, so a replacement watcher polling with os.SameFile

// one tick carries the original's ModTime, and a same-size replacement
// then matches on every eagerly captured field while the lazily loaded

// path again with the same read-only DSN while the Store's original
// connection is still open silently returns the *already open, stale*
// database instance instead of re-reading the file rebuildMirror just
// renamed into place (and a differing DSN errors with "Can't open a
// connection to same database file with a different configuration than
// existing connections"). A hardlink gives the identical bytes a distinct
// path string, so DuckDB treats it as an unrelated database and genuinely
// reads the current file from disk, while the Store's existing connection
// (opened on the literal path before the rename) keeps serving whatever it
// already had open, undisturbed.

// leftover from a process that crashed or was killed before it could clean
// up after itself; it is always safe to remove unconditionally (there is no
// in-progress swap to race: an alias belonging to a live process's
// *current* handle is only ever known to that process, which will remove it
// itself on the next successful reopen or on Close). This is meant to be

// matches the generated alias shape — are never touched. A missing work

// silently breaking or over-matching the sweep. The suffix after the
// prefix must be entirely ASCII digits — the exact shape openMirrorAlias
// generates (time.Now().UnixNano()) — so any other file inside the work
// directory (for example "mirror.duckdb.reopen-backup") survives, and the

	// failure: --fail-on-change must not trip on them. Classification is
	// deliberately conservative -- when the mtime relationship is
	// ambiguous (missing stored mtime, unreadable source) a would-be
	// change is treated as raced rather than risk a false regression --
	// but a change is only ever reclassified when the file was not
	// demonstrably untouched. Scope: the guard reclassifies the per-file
	// compare path only; the presence sweep (a stored ID a clean parse no

	// confined to the incremental-artifact allow-list
	// (diffsConfinedToIncrementalArtifacts). Claude and Codex append new
	// JSONL tails without rewriting the whole session, so a fresh full
	// re-parse can legitimately differ on the ordinal-shape / per-message
	// metadata surface (message_metadata) even at the current data_version
	// and without a pending resync. That change is comparison-basis skew,
	// not parser drift, and is inconclusive: like DiffRaced it is reported
	// for drill-down but never counted as a failure.
	//
	// The confinement is what keeps the marker from masking real
	// regressions: the marker is session-level, but a regression is
	// field-level, so a non-informational diff on any other field
	// (first_message, message_content, usage totals, tool_calls, the
	// recomputed aggregates, ...) keeps the session DiffChanged and trips
	// --fail-on-change even on an incrementally-written row. The frozen
	// session fields the incremental path owns (termination_status,
	// session_name, cwd, ...) are already marked informational and never
	// reach this test. A full resync still gives the cleanest baseline; see
	// the resync recommendation in the CLI report. Precedence is below
	// DiffRaced: when a source both advanced past its snapshot mtime and
	// was last written incrementally, raced wins because the advanced
	// mtime is the stronger, directly-provable diagnosis.
